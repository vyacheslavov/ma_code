 from the chore-offloading services of taskrabbit and handy to the courier apps of deliveroo and jinn, we exist in a golden age of push-button laziness. but just how useful are these things? and is it possible to get through an entire day without lifting more than a solitary index finger, relying solely on apps to wash, clean, transport, deliver, feed and entertain me? bravely, i slump on to the couch. i'm going to find out.

14795;tracxn;"  in india, paytm made big news worldwide in the year 2015 when china's alibaba opened its wallet to invest over half a billion dollars in it. however, beyond paytm and ever since, the fintechs in india have seen a funding slowdown. as per tracxn, the first half of 2016 saw usd 179 million of funding across 46 new start-ups, which is only 20% of what the area received in the previous half year.  to be successful, there must be constant learning. india has lot to learn from global success (and failure) stories in order to consolidate its position in the global fintech club. fintechs thrive on a tripod with three supporting legs: policy & regulatory support, trust and access-to-data. for example, a fintech can take customers' money only if regulated; customers would entrust their money and personal information only if they trust the fintech, and only access to customer data and information can provide the competitive edge to a fintech.  three key essential lessons india can learn from the global experience around fintech are as follows:  policy & regulation: india must study and adopt the best of regulatory initiatives from the global markets. the securities and future commission of hong kong has set up a fintech advisory group to monitor the risks and regulatory implications of developments in fintech. the us has been consistently easing regulatory barriers to investments, of course with sufficient caution. start-ups in new york are offered 100% tax benefit for the first 10 years. the uk is also providing the strongest regulatory support to its fintech sector through taxation, disclosure mandates, consumer protection regulations and risk management. tax incentives in the uk for fintech are being doubled from 50% to 100% from april 2017.     trust: capgemini's report on fintech's tipping point suggests that consumers, while showcasing more trust in established banks, are more likely to use fintech products once tried. hence, if fintechs can get a platform to clearly demonstrate that they are making things simpler, transparent, easy to use, and cheaper with improved customer experience, they have a good chance of winning the trust of customers. fintechs must move towards simplicity and eliminate confusion. stripe, an irish mobile payment platform valued at usd 5 billion changed its name from ""/dev/payments"" to ""stripe"" and demonstrated how the simplicity of brand name can win trust of customers. london-based transferwise built reliability by beating the opaque transaction and exchange rate pricing of traditional banks with their transparent fees of being ten times cheaper than traditional bank rates.     access-to-data: with advances in machine learning and iot, fintechs are all abuzz with the benefits of big data. in fact, the new wave in information theory and management for the fintech industry is called smart data, i.e., instead of mining infinite irrelevant data sets, smart data focuses on key valuable pieces of information that institutions need. we are seeing a rise in marketplace banks, i.e., traditional banks who have started exposing their apis to third parties for large-scale payments transformation. for e. g. national australian bank opened up its api to cloud accounting firm, xero. as part of the australian government plans to introduce regulations to facilitate the growth of fintechs, productivity commission enquiry has been appointed for enhancing data aggregation, sharing & usage, and regulating open data api.  india needs to also leverage the success stories of other expanding hubs worldwide around the following three key areas - the right ecosystem, collaboration and talent.  ecosystem: there is a need for governments to develop a dynamic digital infrastructure which is adaptable and supportive of the fintech ecosystem. the uk has established itself as one of the most attractive locations in fintech with high digital connectivity. virtual currencies, such as bitcoins have been promoted with tax holidays, while many other countries banned their usage. they have aggressive programs in the uk to address entry barriers by launching research initiatives funding for crypto currency and distributed ledger technology. hong kong invest hkincubator program guarantees loans and marketing grants for smes in the country. australia has announced a formal set of fintech priorities like immediate cash-flow benefits and tax savings. the australian government is also planning to roll-out the national broadband network, to expand its digital infrastructure.  india should work towards higher penetration of mobile, internet and iot infrastructure so that communication and connection is smooth across all channels. the government must provide more incubation support to fintechs. there should be policies helping fintech firms to test and refine their products via robust poc projects with indian financial institutions. similar to shoreditch in london, india should convert unused public/private spaces into incubation centers, thereby creating an environment for start-up community. india should relook and revamp the existing traditional banking models in india and propagate initiatives, such as e-kyc, aadhaar-linked payments, account switching and digital passports.  collaboration: over the past year, there has been a shift as banks have moved from seeing fintech companies as disruptors to co-creators. banks are increasingly collaborating with fintechs to embed new services and technologies that improve customer experience and drive efficiency. international banks, such as citi and global consultants, such as kpmg have set up innovation labs, driving tech innovation in financial services. singaporean bank, dbs, has allocated a sgd 10 million investment into the development of the singapore start-up ecosystem. a uk-israel tech hub has been set-up to share leading technology practices. a lot of international events are regularly hosted in the israel region. the uk and singapore entered into a deal to share and use information on financial services innovation by the uk's fca and singapore's mas.  india should organize international events and invite leaders of start-up companies. this can lead to promotion of the digital capabilities of india, thereby attracting investments. many of the us and uk successful start-ups are expanding geographically. india needs to aid them with an effective policy so that these start-ups can build infrastructure in the country.  talent: universities and public institutions must begin nurturing an entrepreneurial mindset with focus on growing skills and entrepreneurial temperament, leading to an accelerated growth in fintech innovation. hong kong is promoting courses dedicated to entrepreneurship. for 2016-17, hong kong has provisioned for 300 university students to gain overseas exposure in the fintech sector through their cyberport hub. accelerators and incubators are gaining traction in the hong kong region. singapore launched skillsfuture, a national program to up-skill singaporeans on various skills. talent retention is as important as hiring and training to begin with. australia, in their federal budget, announced tax concessions under employee share schemes to help early-stage start-ups retain right talent.  india should build a strong technological and entrepreneurial talent pool by engaging its universities and institutions. academic bodies should be encouraged to act as catalysts towards building an innovative mindset of technological advancement and proto-typing from the very beginning.  the relationship between indian banks and fintech start-ups must strengthen in 2017 and gain momentum by leveraging each other's strengths. a win-win situation needs to be created where both the bank and the fintech start-up stand a chance to prosper together.  before asking what fintech can do for india, let us ask what india can do for fintech!";X

17725;hautelook;" nordstrom rack wasn't always the company's biggest bet. the store began in 1973 as basement-level clearance center in nordstrom's downtown seattle location. as off-price and discount stores became more appealing to consumers in the wake of the 2008 recession, so too did nordstrom rack's appeal. by 2016, rack stores were outpacing full-line stores in terms of growth, and reporting sales increases, while full-line sales slumped. and while growth at rack stores has slowed somewhat, the company's decision to avoid mall locations and instead focus on street-level shops has allowed it to side-step at least one of the thornier problems facing similar large-scale retailers.  the seattle-based retailer is hardly alone in betting on off-price. neiman marcus and saks fifth avenue both have a robust store base in the category and macy's, late to this game, is quickly expanding its new backstage concept with plans for 40 by the end of 2017.  ""our customer loves value and on-trend merchandise. so rack is the number one new acquisition point for customers.""  karen mckibbin  executive vice president, nordstrom rack  in addition to its rack and full-line nordstrom stores, the company operates two jeffrey boutiques, with top-line luxury offerings; two last chance clearance stores, which serve as repositories for whatever doesn't sell through the rack stores; nordstrom.com; nordstromrack.com; online sale site hautelook, which it bought in 2011; and trunk club, a personalized clothing service that operates online and via seven ""clubhouses."" according to mckibbin, all of the company's arms are meant to feed into each other. ""our customer loves value and on-trend merchandise,"" she said. ""so rack is the number one new acquisition point for customers. but we also migrate customers to other channels. customers are shopping high and low.""  rack customers can expect to find the same brands, more or less, that they'd see in a full-line nordstrom - rack proudly and pointedly offers 48 of the 50 brands available at nordstrom's full-line stores. and while no one at the event was able to say exactly which two brands were not available, mckibbin smiled and said, ""i'm sure we're working on them.""  but there's clever bit of wordplay involved in the branding language. just because the brand names match doesn't mean the merchandise is the same. in fact, some off-brand stores such as sak's off 5th report that as little as 10% of its in-store merchandise actually came from saks full-line stores. nordstrom rack does slightly better, confirming to racked that 20% of its product comes from full-line stores. the other 80% is purchased expressly for rack stores.  yet for many customers, that's a technicality that doesn't matter. the store offers impressive designer names, from derek lam and alexander wang to cosmetics from bliss and, most recently, m.a.c., which just a few months ago inked a deal to sell its brand at discounted prices through rack stores. prices range from under $10 for sample-sized cosmetics arranged in sephora-style displays to well over $500 for luxury handbags and high-end designer dresses. two neon ""clear the rack"" signs, hung in street-facing windows, flash when even deeper discounts are available, as a sort of high-end version of kmart's bluelight specials. the store offers free wi-fi and even has on-site tailoring and alterations department to provide fitting services free-of-charge. there are also snacks and soda available for purchase in the checkout line, which blurs the distinction between luxury discount store and basement off-price outlet.  and the formula is working, at least so far. mckibbin said that the company would be opening its first nordstrom rack stores in canada in 2018, in toronto, calgary, ottawa and edmonton. and as far as competitors are concerned? ""we see every store who sells thing as our competitor,"" she says. except, of course, for its full-line stores - the company plans to open a men's store in manhattan in 2018, followed by a flagship women's store in 2019.  expanding at a time when many retailers are looking to contract may be a risky maneuver, but it's clear that the company is betting its combination of retail will find just the right fit with consumers.";X

34659;polyvore;"  co-founder and ceo wes ng shared a few tips on how a hong kong product startup can find global success like casetify. focus on a target demographic profile  co-founder and ceo wes ng started casetify in hong kong to give people the power to express themselves through unique and customizable products.  they began in hong kong in 2011. wes was himself an instagram addict and noticed that after posting interesting pictures, he would receive some engagement but that was the end of it. he then thought, ""wouldn't it be great if we could turn these great photos into real products?"" that's how casetify (then called casetigram) was born.  the decision to start in hong kong wasn't a conscious choice for him. he is from hong kong, so it was quite natural to start there. hong kong is also at the forefront for phones in asia, because they're cheaper to purchase here, so everyone is hyper connected, it's a picture and selfie capital, and most people do require a phone case. hong kong made as much sense as a place to start as anywhere else for casetify, in that regard. benefits of a product company working in hong kong  because of its proximity to china, having a headquarters in hong kong definitely has its perks for physical product-focused companies. they've capitalized on hong kong's unique balance and blend of centralized international asia talent and connections to manufacturing, which is just a short mtr ride across the border.  casetify considers itself a ""full stack"" company, building, branding, manufacturing and shipping its own products. these important business aspects wouldn't cut and paste as neatly into other countries.  leveraging on the power of social media and influencers  they are currently working with many big brands like colette, bbc icecream, lane crawford, hillary duff, karen mok, and fiona sit - but how did that happen? with casetify, it's because many of the celebrities were already using their products and they discovered their product through social media. fans or the celebrities themselves might tag them, in turn allowing them to locate social media savvy celebrities and influencers.  their first customer ever was actually from spain, most likely from a twitter referral. because of their focus on building a fan base on social media, and their instinctively social savvy audience, casetify is used and commented on in social media by people like lionel messi, kobe bryant and snoop dogg. differences in founders from east and west  co-founder and ceo wes ng has had much experience working in many different places and cultures. in fact, casetify probably has more brand recognition in the united states than in asia. i asked him - can the west, hong kong, and asia learn anything from each other?  he says, in terms of startups outside of asia, it's very different. with many friends and frequent visits to silicon valley, he still sees gaps in terms of execution and the openness to discuss ideas. he feels this is especially true in some industries, especially when compared to china where ecommerce is mature and there is a widespread use of mobile payments.  in terms of ideas, he feels people in the east can be hesitant to share their ideas, when we should all be less afraid to do so because an idea is simply the start of something. a company or founder will have 1000 followup ideas or questions that require execution, so execution is actually the most important component to success.  awareness and business growth through niche social media networks  while established social media networks are great to tap into to find fans and build your brand, more niche ones can sometimes be just as valuable.  for example, casetify uses snapchat for many of its events. their staff might provide a sneak peak of an exclusive event, giving a behind the scenes look using snapchat. they also use it and other social media tools to conduct ""flash sales"", where they'll send out a message and the first 50 or 100 customers can get in on a limited time offer, which is an effective way to reach an audience with purchase intent.  other social media platforms they mentioned that are worth investigating in america, which you might not have heard of, are keep, a place to discover and buy the latest trends in fashion, home decor, accessories and design, wanelo, which is a ""mobile mall"", with, surprisingly, over half a million stores and polyvore, a community-powered social commerce website.  it's important to know on a deeper level how users engage on each respective channel. for example, casetify knows that snapchat is an incredible platform for storytelling and uses it for that purpose. the future of product startups?  casetify itself has moved away from having cases as their only product offering (they've recently dived into the world of watch straps), but they stress that it took much planning and time. companies should stay focused and resist the temptation to move too fast into new product categories.  wes believes that the future of retail is an interplay of online and offline. those who understand how retail and e-commerce interact, and how these interactions will affect business, will be the leaders of tomorrow.";X

'we are delighted to partner with payoneer to offer our talented freelancers and entrepreneurs a better way to accept payments from their clients abroad with greater ease. we look forward to seeing them avail the convenience and security afforded by our platforms and grow their businesses globally,' he added.

 payoneer, an innovative cross-border payments company transforming the way businesses pay and get paid globally, announced today that it has partnered and integrated with ez cash, sri lanka's leading mobile money network and a brand of the dialog axiata group, which commands 50% of the country's mobile market.

 payoneer's direct business general manager eyal moldovan said: 'we are delighted to partner with ez cash to further localise our cross-border payment solutions for the sri lankan market and are committed to partnering with additional mobile payment networks and ewallets throughout the world. alliances such as this further cement our position as the go-to solution for freelancers and small businesses, empowering professionals and business owners worldwide to get paid globally as easily as they do locally.'

 through the integration, sri lankan entrepreneurs, merchants and freelancers are able to withdraw cross-border payments they receive using payoneer straight to their ez cash mobile accounts, where they can make a host of local payments with greater ease. the partnership marks another step in payoneer's roadmap to make payments for smbs more seamless, flexible and more localised than ever before. ez cash will market payoneer to its small business customers as a value-added service.

 the integration enables ez cash's 14 million subscribers to leverage payoneer's cross-border capabilities to connect with marketplaces and clients worldwide. ez cash customers can send and receive funds across the network's user base, receive inward remittances from abroad, make online purchases and settle utility bills directly from their mobile phone.

 zoox's spokesman (it has one of those now, too) did not respond to requests for comment on its funding plans, or recent hiring activity.

 having the backing of at least one mega-corporation like tencent (potentially two, if the softbank talks amount to anything) will be important. because zoox will certainly need a lot of money to fulfil its lofty goals.

 executives at entertainment shopping, the german company that runs swoopo, counter that the auctions are fun and challenging while offering the possibility of a killer deal.

 last month, carolyn parslow, who manages a flea market in trumbull, ohio, won a new refrigerator on swoopo for $9.66 - plus the $61.80 she spent on bids. but she sounds a note of caution, saying that she has lost far more auctions than she has won, and that there does not appear to be a way to gain a persistent edge over rival bidders.

 swoopo avoids fraud by selling all of the products itself, often shipping them directly from suppliers. bidding starts at zero, and players can bid up the auction price only in small set increments, like one, two or six cents. swoopo also offers its own automated bidding tool on the site, called bid butler. there is no possibility that users can ''snipe'' an auction at the last moment, because a few seconds are added to the clock with every new bid.

 nevertheless, swoopo's unique spin on the internet auction appears to be suddenly in vogue. this spring, august capital, a silicon valley venture capital firm, invested $10 million in entertainment shopping, financing its expansion to the united states.

 competing bidders spent a cumulative $2,337 in their losing effort to buy the $1,498 refrigerator, for example. swoopo says it must spend much of that revenue to advertise the auctions and attract customers to the site. the company says it had 2.5 million visitors in july, double the number it had a year earlier, and a total of 2.5 million registered users.

 that, incidentally, creates the impression of swoopo auctions that are about to end but last for hours more, a feature of the site that critics say is subtly misleading.

 i. nelson rose, a consultant to the gambling industry and a professor at whittier law school, said u.s. government regulators would probably evaluate swoopo and its ilk not as games of skill or luck, but as auction sites. in that respect, he said, the law on the topic is somewhat gray.  ''it turns out the idea of paying for bids does not seem to be specifically allowed by states, as it is in most of europe,'' mr. rose said. ''but it doesn't seem to be explicitly prohibited, either.''

 ''in aggregate, consumers trying to obtain these products are overpaying,'' said glen whitney, a mathematician and a former quantitative analyst at the hedge fund renaissance technologies, who was asked to evaluate swoopo. ''unless you have an edge over other people who are bidding, and you can get them to subsidize your purchase, you shouldn't do it. it's a chump's game.''

 mr. marchevsky argues that winning on swoopo requires dexterity and patience  - players must know when an auction is likely to end, so they can allocate their time and money. and they should never bid if they are not serious about prevailing.

 but there's a catch, of course: swoopo users are charged 60 cents every time they bid, and those charges add up fast.

 swoopo recently acknowledged that one aspect of the game is not much fun: spending money to bid on products that someone else wins. last month the site began allowing users to apply that money toward buying the product at full price. swoopo's retail prices are marginally above those offered by sites like amazon.

 in that regard, the company behind swoopo is not taking chances, retaining a well-known gambling lawyer, anthony cabot of the las vegas law firm  lewis and roca, as an adviser.

 in addition to a growing number of small swoopo imitators with names like gobid and rockybid, another startup, project fair bid, has raised $4.5 million from three u.s. venture capital firms and plans to unveil its site next march.

 these critics also say that players face long odds in swoopo's auctions, where they must compete against people in the united states, britain and germany. and they note that swoopo is making a nice profit on each item when all the bidding fees are tallied.

 nick marchevsky, a 27-year-old unemployed designer from sewell, new jersey, is more successful than most swoopo users: he says he has won 27 items over the past few months, including digital cameras, tvs and macintosh computers. but his strategy, he says, is simple, bullheaded persistence. he spends up to two hours in each auction and makes sure he outspends other bidders.";X

 the group made strong progress in the first half of 2017, with an accelerating  pace of technology, innovation and product development, and a further strengthening of our customer relationships and market reach.  these enhanced capabilities have reinforced the group's ability to drive future growth by capitalising on the structural growth drivers in the payments market, and have further increased the group's already strong visibility of future earnings.  the group delivered a robust financial performance, against the exceptionally strong growth we saw in the first half of 2016.  the value of transactions processed increased by 11% to gbp241.4bn, similar to the rate of growth in 2016.  this supported net revenue growth of 11% which, while it included a

 global ecom delivered further strategic and financial progress.  net revenue grew 17%, representing a sustained strong performance given the 25% growth in the first half of 2016.  the majority of global ecom's growth continues to be derived from its existing portfolio of customers, notably in this half year in the retail, airline and digital industry verticals, benefiting from both their underlying growth, and wallet share gains as we enhance the value we deliver to  them.  in terms of products, acquiring, treasury management and foreign exchange services, and gateway saw strong growth in this period.  global ecom also performed well in retaining and expanding contracts with existing customers, including azul, hong kong express and dwi digital cameras, amongst others.  global ecom's pipeline of potential new business remains very strong, further supporting the visibility of growth in the division over the longer-term. in the first half of the year, global ecom signed a number of contracts with new customers from a broad mix of industry verticals and geographies, including vanilla air, hobby king, televisa and copa.  global ecom continues to increase its exposure to faster-growing regions in terms of geography, with the division's asia-pacific and latin american business growing at substantial rates.  the strong growth in these regions is being supported by new acquiring capabilities in brazil and argentina which have created a strong platform for growth in the latin american region.  the group also continued to further strengthen its global acquiring network, with the launch of domestic acquiring capabilities in malaysia and turkey, helping to improve transaction acceptance, while maintaining their full compliance with  local rules and regulations.  the strength of global ecom's customer proposition was further reinforced in the first half by the delivery of a broad range of new products and enhancements.  these included updates to the applepay and androidpay mobile

 wpuk made good progress in the first half on its strategy to deliver more value for merchants, and delivered net revenue growth of 2%.  this result reflects a demanding comparative period in the first half of 2016 (with very strong net revenue growth of 12%), year-on-year increases in scheme fees, and the deceleration in uk consumer spending growth towards the end of the first half of 2017.  wpuk is expected to deliver strong net revenue growth in the second half of the year, primarily driven by changes in sales strategy, pricing  changes to recover the increased scheme fees, and the accelerated take-up of value-added products and services.  underlying ebitda also grew 2%, a strong performance given a gbp3.3m bad debt charge relating to the collapse of a travel sector merchant.  underlying ebitda also included for the first time an allocation of costs relating to the new acquiring platform; excluding these, operating costs fell by 3%.  in the sme segment, my business dashboard, wpuk's online merchant tool, now
