1891;solarreserve;"link explains: ""the energy-supply agreement can be structured such that all technologies are integrated behind the fence at solarreserve's facility, or solarreserve can transfer control of the assets to the mine operator. in either case, the mine will enjoy a guaranteed fixed price of energy for the life of the project.

 solarreserve configures custom solutions based on the generating capacity, load factor, solar resource, level of fuel reduction, grid power availability and degree of power-infrastructure replacement desired.

 link says: ""solarreserve's flagship 110mw crescent dunes solar energy plant in nevada, us, with 10 hours of full-load energy storage, is the world's first utility-scale facility to feature advanced molten-salt power-tower energy-storage capabilities.""

 to deliver reliable and cost-effective 24/7 base load power, solarreserve is developing csp projects that integrate substantial pv into the design. link states: ""these 'hybrid' csp and pv projects can compete with traditional generation while providing emission-free and low-water-use generation.""

 solarreserve has an aggressive road map for performance improvements, optimisation and cost reduction. the company is already realising substantial cost optimisations in the technology, including cost and efficiency improvements for its next project in south africa. the heliostat field (mirrors) accounts for roughly 40% of the project's capital expenditure (capex) and represents the greatest opportunity for cost reduction. the key factors for this to happen are overall improvements and efficiencies in the design of the structures, control systems and the mirror facets.

 including the copiapo project, solarreserve currently has three projects in advanced stages of development in chile. the copiapo project will inject predictable, non-intermittent energy into the sistema interconectado central (sic) in the central part of the country, for delivery to a mining off-taker in that region.

 in addition, the copiapo solar energy project, in the atacama desert in northern chile, is a hybrid configuration utilising solarreserve's proprietary csp molten-salt thermal energy-storage technology combined with pv.

 graphic: picture 1, conergy's energy-storage technology has been engineered, developed and tested for remote locations that are without any power supply picture 2, crescent dune's 1.1gwh storage capability is almost 40 times the size of the largest battery storage project in construction or built to date, photo: solarreserve picture 3, a cad of highview power storage's new 5mw pre-commercial laes technology demonstrator

 link says: ""solarreserve's us developed proprietary storage technology is a fraction of the cost of utility-scale battery storage with virtually no performance degradations over time. and the molten salt never needs replacement for the entire 30+ year life of the plant.""

 solarreserve offers an end-to-end energy supply solution, which includes suitability assessment, technology configuration, permitting, finance and engineering, procurement and construction (epc) management, and ongoing power-plant operations or operational support.";
1893;solarreserve;"""we are pleased to continue our efforts to bring affordable clean energy to consumers, as well as deliver highly viable projects from our successful pv development efforts in the us,"" said kevin smith, ceo of solarreserve. ""these pv projects developed here in our home state are part of our global large-scale solar project development portfolio of more than 6.6 gigawatts (gw), which includes our advanced solar thermal technology, photovoltaic technology, and combined solutions that can deliver reliable, 24/7 baseload solar power that is cost-competitive with conventional energy sources.""

 the projects range in size from 20 mw to 25 mw -- in tulare, kings, and fresno counties in california -- and will power around 25,000 homes in the area. the projects were acquired from a partnership between solarreserve, llc and gcl solar energy, inc.";

 last month, data presented at the american college of cardiology (acc) annual meeting and simultaneously published in the new england journal of medicine showed that patient results with corevalve system were superior to surgical aortic valve replacement (savr) at one year in patients at increased risk for surgery. this is the first time a prospective, randomized study has shown any transcatheter aortic valve to be superior to surgery.

 about corevalve the corevalve system received approval from the fda in january. based on the strength of the clinical data, the fda quickly reviewed and approved the corevalve system for patients at extreme risk for surgical valve replacement in january. the corevalve system is not yet approved in the u.s. for other patient groups.

payments to the card immediately. this means that when you get paid via apple cash, you're going to be able to spend that money right away as long as it's via apple cash to someone else or via apple pay at a retailer or website that accepts it.  apple is working with green dot to power the financial mechanics of apple cash. there's obviously some small float involved here on instant transactions.  the card also functions as a transaction log for all of your apple pay purchases on the web or at physical locations. just tap on the 'i' icon to flip the card in wallet to see them. you can also add money to the card from this screen from any funding source. touch id, passcode or face id are used to verify any apple pay cash transaction.  when you get money for the first time, you'll tap on the payment bubble to accept terms, the card will get generated and put into your wallet and the balance will instantly appear on that card. from there you can use it or transfer it out to your bank (with the normal transaction times).  this isn't a card that anyone can just 'use' like a credit or debit card though. if, for instance, you're splitting rent and your roommate pays you for their half you have the following options:  if your landlord uses an iphone and will accept it you can send that on directly to them via messages     you can transfer it to your bank account and pay them via check or debit  otherwise, they'd have to be an apple pay merchant for you to just boop your phone and pay them on a terminal or via the web.  i'd be remiss if i didn't mention that there are already several very widely used person-to-person payment systems out there like square's cash, venmo, alipay and wechat pay. apple is certainly doing a job of 'validating their space' with this launch, but i'd expect some press from those firms with a variety of vanity metrics and differentiating factors like ""cross platform,"" ""social"" and ""popular with youths"". i personally really like square's cash a ton and my close group has long used it to pay each other back and balance our friendship books. it will be interesting to see how apple pay cash affects that behavior among people who have mixed iphone/android usage.  sending and receiving works pretty much as you'd expect. if you ask for money in a text, say 'hey you owe me $10 for movie tickets', the other party can tap on the underlined dollar amount and send it. you can also use the pay cash app in messages to send a formal request, they'll see that and can tap to pay. when they send it you'll get a notification and you tap on that to accept the money. you can choose to automatically accept payments or not in settings. the first time you use it you'll have to accept the money within 7 days.  you can also send money directly from the contacts app in ios by tapping a contact and then the $ icon below their name. siri, of course, is also involved and you can use it to send money or request money from a friend. saying ""ask sally to pay me $10 for breakfast"" will send that message via messages and they can tap and pay.  apple pay cash provides the vital person-to-person leg of apple's payments stool. the journey began back in 2012 when it introduced passbook, a place to hold airplane tickets and other coupon-type stuff. even back then, it was clear where apple was headed with this. i remember writing extensively about the way apple was building up to offering a payments platform:  say apple hooks up an ipayment card of some sort to your itunes account and tucks it into passbook. perhaps you enter a passcode to get into passbook, then type in your apple id and it generates a 2d code, then you scan it, and the code expires after a billing has been made to it. or the url can require a passcode, generating a new link for each transaction...unless, and this comes back to trust, apple required a direct connection to your bank account to enable your apple id for direct payments. this would be a hard sell, but it would be making that pitch to people who have already trusted credit cards to it for some time, so it's not as outlandish as you think.  back then, we were still in a big trust deficit hole with mobile payments (and qr codes are still finding their place) but the years since have proven that people are willing to pay with their phone. an impressive recent stat notes that 50% of all us retail locations now accept apple pay and that 90% of all mobile contactless transactions in markets where it is available are done with apple pay. clearly, people get that money and mobile go together, and they're becoming more willing to treat a digital wallet like their physical wallet.  as i put it in 2012:  the fact of the matter is that people, by and large, are not ready for mobile payments. i'm probably not even ready and i'm an early adopter. this is why other technologies like nfc haven't taken off for google or other mobile makers that have tried to make it happen.  there is a trust threshold that hasn't yet been breached by any major company, although services like square are making headway. apple is uniquely positioned to take its current cachet with regards to credit cards and build on that through the redemption of passes and gift cards through passbook. once it has this kind of trust, it can use nfc hardware in a future phone to further expand its payment options.  now that we're here, you owe me $10.";

 for site owners who fear that real-name commenting represents a risk too far, there is a halfway house: pseudonymity' ie a system in which commenters are allowed to choose their own user names, but have to associate them with a valid email address (which in the last analysis could be used as an identifier). last year, disqus, a company that provides an online discussion and commenting service for websites, published some useful research on the behaviour of different types of site user.

 the purpose of the research was to address the criticism that there is no substantive difference between pseudonymous and anonymous commenters. disqus begged to differ, arguing that whereas real names are for authentication (establishing who you are), pseudonyms are for expression: they imply ""a choice of identity"" and therefore have a communicative function. the company looked through its database of 60 million users and 500m comments to see how commenting practice differed between users who were completely anonymous, those who used pseudonyms and those who had registered via facebook (and therefore were obliged to use their real names).";

 farmobile aims to captures and streams data through tractors, irrigation systems, and other smart machinery so that it can be cross-compared and analysed. this could mean taking data collected by different companies and brands. but the company will also allow farmers to protect the data they share with farmobile's cloud, so that the farmers will own their own data and be able to sell to third parties.";

 once at the family's backyard, the flirtey drone hovered in place and gently lowered each package. the purchases, including drinks, a chicken sandwich, donuts, hot coffee and candy, were delivered to the family in the span of a few minutes.

 the faa-approved delivery was the first time a us customer has received a package to their home via drone, representing a historic milestone in both u.s. and global commerce. the delivery, conducted in celebration of the convenience store chain's 89th birthday, also advances research toward integrating drones into the us national airspace system.   at a reno, nevada 7eleven® store, two deliveries were successfully completed. 7eleven merchandise - including hot and cold food items - were loaded into a unique flirtey drone delivery container and flown autonomously using precision gps to a local customer's house.

50786;predpol;"but when researchers in the us examined how predpol predicts crime, they found something disturbing. their study suggests that the software merely sparks a ""feedback loop"" that leads to officers being repeatedly sent to certain neighbourhoods - typically ones with a high number of racial minorities - regardless of the true crime rate in that area (arxiv.org/abs/1706.09847).

 the problem stems from the logic that predpol uses to decide where officers should be sent. if an officer is sent to a neighbourhood and then makes an arrest, the software takes this as indicating a good chance of more crimes in that area in future.

 pre-crime tech is catching on in the us. predpol - a market-leading system - is already used by police departments in places such as california, florida and maryland. their hope is that such systems will bring down crime rates while simultaneously reducing human bias in policing.

 what this means, says matt kusner at the alan turing institute in london, is that the predpol system seems to be learning from arrest rates - which are higher in areas where there are more police - rather than from underlying crime rates.

 ""that's how dangerous feedback loops are,"" says joshua loftus at new york university, who wasn't involved in the study. although these loops are only part of how predpol makes its predictions, he says they may explain why predictive policing algorithms have sometimes seemed to recreate exactly the kind of racial biases their creators say they overcome.

 to better understand how the system comes to its conclusions, the study team created a simplified mathematical model of the predpol software. the algorithm chooses how to distribute a certain number of officers between two locations. if more are sent to one location, they tend to make more arrests there. the team found that this feeds back into the system and leads it to send even more officers to that same place.";

53452;moviepass;"  meanwhile, if you're looking for a new game to sap your attention all weekend, framed 2 serves up another puzzling adventure based around the concept of rearranging comic book panels. and if you need even more options, moviepass lets you see loads of movies in theaters each month for cheap, swim out is a clever new puzzler, and file-sharing favorite droplr finally makes its way to android.  hamilton - the official app  whether you're knee-deep in fandom for hamilton or you aspire to love the broadway phenomenon (but still haven't had a chance to see it), then hamilton - the official app is for you. like most official tie-in apps, it has an array of digital bits related to the subject. here, there's a #hamcam camera that puts themed overlays on your shots, as well as stickers, news, and access to buy merch and tickets.  but the most appealing draw may be the hamilton lottery. for each show, a limited number of tickets are held back and offered to winners of a random lottery, which lets lucky fans buy a pair for $10 apiece. right now, you can only use the app to enter the daily lottery for the los angeles production, and both new york and chicago will be added to the app within the next week or so. if you're near to any of those cities and want to see the show on the cheap, then put this app into your daily rotation.  framed 2  the original framed was one of our favorite games of 2015, so we've been looking forward to the debut of framed 2 ($5) for a long while now. here it is, and it's on sale for just $2 this week to boot. serving as a prequel to the original game, framed 2 largely sticks to what worked so well before: it's a puzzle game disguised as a comic book, with panels that need to be rearranged sequentially to safely move ahead.  you'll drag and drop the panels to help the shadowy hero evade capture or attack, and framed 2 is even more polished and impressively presented than the original. however, if the trial-and-error approach of framed drove you nuts, then this follow-up isn't likely to change your mind. and if somehow you haven't played the first framed, well, it's on sale for only $0.12 right now. you read that right, twelve cents!  moviepass  maybe you've heard of moviepass: it's the subscription service that lets you pay a single monthly fee for the ability to see one film per day at participating movie theaters. however, at the original $50/month price, there were seemingly few takers. but in a dramatic move to build a user base, the company slashed the price to $10/month this week. and since the website has frequently been down since then, we're guessing there's some interest.  the android app is a key part of the experience, as you'll use it to find nearby theaters and select a movie. there are limitations-only 2d flicks, you can't select future dates, and you have to ""buy"" the tickets in person with your moviepass card-but otherwise, you really can pick a flick to go see each and every day. it's an incredible deal for anyone who goes to the movies often, but since at least one big theater chain is already upset about the price drop, you should probably act fast.  swim out  navigating a busy swimming pool might not seem like the most exhilarating game concept, but it actually proves quite clever in swim out ($2.59). you'll start at one point in the pool and need to find your way to the ladder to exit, but in your path are other swimmers, lounging ladies, and little brats eager to make a big splash. and it's your imperative to get out of there without causing a scene.  amusingly, this turn-based puzzler feels a lot like lara croft go and hitman go-it's all about navigating the terrain safely, although the vibe here is super chill. along with noticing and exploiting other swimmers' patterns, you'll need to use the occasional beach ball to stun someone, or watch out for waves that ripple out from a kid's cannonball.  droplr for android  droplr has been a handy resource for several years now, but while there are desktop plugins and an ios client, there hasn't been an official android app... until now, that is. essentially, droplr is a dead-simple cloud sharing service that lets you quickly upload a file and get a sharable link with no fuss. you can log in with your google account or even slack, drop in photos, screenshots, and other files, and then post the links to chat, twitter, or wherever.  like the service itself, the android app is streamlined and effective for speedy drops. the free service comes with some limitations, such as just 10 drops per month and bandwidth caps, but there are pro and business plans available for anyone who comes to rely on droplr.";

  oncopep's lead program, pvx-410, is a multi-peptide therapeutic cancer vaccine that is designed to target specific antigens found on the surface of multiple myeloma (mm) cancer cells. mm is a cancer of the plasma cells for which there is currently no cure.  the initial clinical target is smoldering multiple myeloma, a precursor disease to mm for which there are no approved treatments. pvx-410 was granted orphan drug designation from the u.s. food and drug administration in 2013. the company initiated a phase 1/2a clinical trial in the u.s. for pvx-410 in smoldering multiple myeloma (smm) in january 2013. the study is actively recruiting patients with a confirmed diagnosis of smm. to date, oncopep has been financed by angel groups, family foundations, individuals and the leukemia & lymphoma society (lls). lls' decision to participate in the financing round resulted from a review of oncopep's application for funding from lls' therapy acceleration program (tap), which identifies therapies that have the potential to change the standard of care for patients with blood cancers.";
59196;currensee;"there's plenty of cheap talk on social media's bright future and its potential to turn friends and followers into profit. however, thus far, returns have failed to live up to the hype. except in forex trading, where social networks like currensee and etoro allow you to not only follow and interact with other traders, but also copy them - mimicking the trades of the most successful traders on the internet.

 with in excess of 1.5m users in over 130 countries, etoro traders use its trading platform, while with currensee, chief executive dave lemont explains you can use any platform and they will execute the trade on your behalf in under one second.

 currensee works off the social network of its traders. after due diligence, the chosen few - of the 8,000 members - are selected to become trade leaders who can be followed individually or as part of a broader portfolio of forex traders. so far, $12m (£7.5m) has been invested in its trade leaders investment program since its october 2010 launch - increasing four-fold in three months. trade leaders earn 20 per cent commission from the profits of their followers, while currensee charges 2 per cent. crucially copiers only pay commission to traders on the basis of profits across their whole portfolio.";
59307;wikinvest;" would you trust a web site created by anonymous individuals to give you better advice on stocks than professional advisers? wikinvest hopes so.

 following the model of wikipedia, the online encyclopedia that anyone can edit, wikinvest is building a database of user-generated investment information on popular stocks. a senior at yale writes about the energy industry, for example, while a former stockbroker covers technology and a mother in arizona tracks children's retail chains.

 to try to prevent that, wikinvest, like other wiki sites, requires contributions to be factual and to cite evidence, and it depends on users to quickly remove those that are not. it ranks contributors based on how frequently they write and how often their changes are undone by others. it covers companies only with a market value of at least $100 million because they are more actively traded and less susceptible to price manipulation.

 the site appeals to investors who are knowledgeable and curious about investing and do it themselves, said michiel de boer, director of technology strategy at zecco, an online brokerage firm that licenses wikinvest content.

 wikinvest, which recently licensed some content to the web sites of usa today and forbes, seeks to be an alternative to web portals that are little more than ''a data dump'' of income statements and government filings, said parker conrad, a co-founder.";
