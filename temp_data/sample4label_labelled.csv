293;xenex;"xenex's germ-fighting robots use pulsed xenon, an environmentally-friendly noble gas, to create intense, full spectrum(tm) uv light that destroys infectious germs in less than five minutes. hospitals using xenex devices have published clinical outcome studies in peer-reviewed journals showing 50-100 percent decreases in c.diff, mrsa and surgical site infection rates when those hospitals used the xenex robots to disinfect rooms.

  ochsner health system is committed to its comprehensive strategy for preventing healthcare associated infections (hai) and enhancing the culture of safety at its hospitals, as demonstrated by its participation in the xenex no risk infection rate reduction program(tm). recognizing the growing threat of antibiotic resistance and superbugs, ochsner medical center - jefferson highway recently deployed a fleet of xenex lightstrike® germ-zapping robots® , which is yielding substantial results. data analysis of the first 90 days of the program demonstrated that the hospital experienced a 49% reduction in clostridium difficile (c.diff) and 49% reduction in overall infection rates after adding lightstrike pulsed xenon ultraviolet (uv) light room disinfection to its cleaning protocol.

 lightstrike robots quickly destroy microscopic pathogens and multi-drug resistant organisms and are used in addition to the routine cleaning procedures that currently take place as an extra level of protection against infection. in august 2017, ochsner deployed 10 lightstrike robots at its jefferson highway campus to enhance the room disinfection process in the hospital. the lightstrike robots were provided under xenex's no risk infection rate reduction program(tm). ochsner evaluated the success of its lightstrike program based upon specific reductions in c.diff, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) infection rates.

 xenex's patented full spectrum(tm) pulsed xenon uv room disinfection system is used for the advanced disinfection of healthcare facilities. due to its speed and ease of use, the xenex system has proven to integrate smoothly into hospital cleaning operations. xenex's mission is to save lives and reduce suffering by destroying the deadly microorganisms that cause hais. the company is backed by well-known investors that include ew healthcare partners, piper jaffray merchant banking, malin corporation, battery ventures, targeted technology fund ii, tectonic ventures and rk ventures. for more information, visit www.xenex.com .";P

""dialpad has built an outstanding customer support organization that partnered with xero's it team to implement our shared vision of bringing a seamless pure-cloud communications solution to every employee in 20 separate worldwide office locations.""

 xero removes the desk phone with dialpad's solution; dialpad's pure-cloud solution enables xero to instantly provision offices and connect teams across the globe

 ""xero is a poster child for how agile, fast-growing companies can leverage a modern anywhere it stack to empower its workers with the communication tools they need - anywhere, anytime, using any device - while dramatically cutting cost and simplifying administration,"" said vincent paquet, chief product officer at dialpad. ""it's clearly time for all companies - both large and small - to cut the cord on legacy technology like xero did and embrace the cloud.""

 about dialpaddialpad is communications simplified for every business. available on any device, anywhere, dialpad includes voice, video, messaging and meetings; and is integrated with microsoft office 365 and google's g suite. dialpad is also the only business communications system built on the google cloud platform. today, over 50,000 customers and more than 65 percent of the fortune 500 have joined dialpad's mission to kill the desk phone, including uber, motorola solutions, vivint solar, xero, financial times, betterment, pagerduty, stripe, quora, and others. dialpad is funded by some of the world's best-recognized investors including amasia, andreessen horowitz, felicis ventures, gv (formerly google ventures), section 32, softbank and work-bench. to learn more about our mission to kill the desk phone, visitdialpad.comand follow@dialpadhqon twitter or like us onfacebook.

   dialpadtoday announced that xero, a global small business platform, has completed the deployment of dialpad's pure-cloud business communications solution across its global offices and is now 100 percent desk phone free. xero selected dialpad to modernize the company's telephony infrastructure and support its rapid growth and international expansion efforts, as one of the largest and fastest growing companies in australasia.

 dialpad replaces outdated desk phones and on-premises pbx equipment with a modern software-only solution that enables fast growth companies like xero to instantly spin up offices and connect international teams across any device with voice, messaging, video, and meetings. with its seamless integration with google's g suite and salesforce, dialpad has also enabled xero to modernize its it stack to ensure collaboration and productivity for employees no matter where they live or work.

 ""as a company built in the cloud, using a single easy-to-use communications solution that connects mission critical tools is really the future of work,"" said andrew jessett, general manager of internal it at xero. ""it doesn't make sense for companies to keep using legacy pbx systems that cost a fortune to install, maintain, and are massively underutilized by employees. completely ripping out all of our systems and desk phones across 10 offices and deploying dialpad has saved us nearly half a million dollars in costs already. this shows just how much smart it decisions can impact a business' bottom line today.""

 like most fast-growing, geographically dispersed companies, xero inherited a real mix of underutilized on-premise pbx systems. they were struggling to control costs and manage multiple local vendors as it opened new offices. the company recognized that a software-first communications strategy was key to supporting its dispersed and mobile workforce, while cutting costs. after reviewing several options, xero selected dialpad as the solution that:";P

 atreca reports on tumor-fighting responses in b cells from patients with non-progressing metastatic cancers; new research findings published in clinical immunology

 ""we are proud of this seminal work, having discovered key features of patient immune responses to cancer. by examining single patient b cells, atreca has a unique opportunity to understand productive anti-tumor responses and develop effective, next-generation cancer immunotherapies,"" said tito a. serafini, ph.d., atreca's president, chief executive officer, and co-founder. ""based on these and other compelling research findings, atreca is executing on its goals of both identifying the widest range of antibodies targeting public tumor antigens and advancing a robust therapeutic pipeline using that information.""

 atreca is a privately held biotechnology company developing novel therapeutics drawn from human immune responses, including effective anti-cancer immune responses. we are able to measure and analyze the structure of clinically relevant immune responses to identify the antibodies, t cell receptors, and targets that are key to successful treatment outcomes. atreca's proprietary immune repertoire capture® technology profiles a patient's immune response at the single-cell level at very high throughput essentially without bias or error, enabling the identification and generation of functional human antibodies and tcrs without prior knowledge of antigen. the company is advancing a pipeline of candidates designed to engage the human immune response in oncology and other indications, thus driving better therapeutic outcomes. for more information on atreca, please visit www.atreca.com .

  atreca, inc., a biotechnology company focused on developing novel therapeutics based on a deep understanding of the human immune response, announced today publication of noteworthy results in preclinical cancer research enabled by atreca's immune repertoire capture® (irc(tm)) technology. as reported in clinical immunology (doi: 10.1016/j.clim.2017.10.002 ), atreca scientists, collaborating with researchers at stanford university and california pacific medical center, demonstrated that patients with non-progressing, metastatic cancer generate antibodies directed against public tumor antigens (epitopes present in tumors of more than one patient) in a manner having the hallmarks of a typical antigen-driven humoral immune response. in preclinical in vivo models, certain of these antibodies also induce tumor regression and durable anti-tumor immunity. the research involved the sequencing and analysis of native antibodies accessed from single b cells in the active, ongoing anti-tumor immune responses of non-progressing patients with metastatic melanoma, lung adenocarcinoma, or renal cell carcinoma.

 ""this published research further confirms our ability to use irc(tm) technology to validate b cell responses as a vital window for understanding effective patient immune responses in cancer, including the discovery of patient antibodies serving as the foundation for therapeutic discovery,"" commented william h. robinson, m.d., ph.d., atreca board member, co-founder, and associate professor of medicine in the division of immunology and rheumatology of the department of medicine at stanford university, as well as co-author on the published research.

""8vc is proud to be working closely with the expert and deeply talented dealpath team.""

5604;alorum;"alorum is also offering a presentation sharing community,http://seoslid.es, to which users can embed directly from their own wordpress site.  given the wordpress community is multiples larger than the current slide sharing community, backlinks and customer discovery on seoslid.es will quickly become a tremendously valuable resource for users' embedded content.

   every day entrepreneurs, experts and marketers give away their online content, just to pay to get their own customers back.  alorum has built a solution that allows these users to own and control both their content and leads, all the way through the acquisition funnel, including those originated offline.

 for more information about alorum (http://alorum.com/press), the seoslides plugin (http://seoslides.com), or the seoslid.es community (http://seoslid.es) please contact daniel james scott at 727-324-9579 oremail.

 after raising a $191,500 seed round, including from seed stage fund gazelle lab, alorum worked closely with 10up, the team behind techcrunch.com, 9to5mac.com and dozens of wordpress plugins, to build an enterprise-quality plugin being launched today in beta.

 the concept for seoslides is alorum's attempt to scratch their own itch.  having spent seven years building wordpress sites for their clients, the top struggle reported was customer acquisition.  large content aggregation sites promised leads, yet mostly collected fees while providing little value.

 using alorum's free wordpress plugin, seoslides, users can simply create or import any presentation directly in their own website.  the seoslides plugin represents the first fully embeddable, multi-page content on wordpress.  where current posts and pages are stand-alone pages, your presentations will be composed of slides that are each a page, with seo optimizable notes.  since the content is owned, there are no restrictions on media - users can place live links in any slide, add videos, or even reorder their decks on the fly.  when published, presentations appear native, regardless of browser or device, including swiping through slides from a mobile phone.";P

2796;vestorly;" deserve to hear it from the horses mouth [sic] . . . .  just please, make sure they understand that without a doubt this was not a  client issue, a business issue[,] a practice issue[,] or a team hr issue. it was  purely internal ubs admin stuff that i go[t] tied up in as we spoke about.  pl.'s ex. 24 at 2. this e-mail shows that mr. fiore had already spoken to ms. jacklin about  ubs's termination of his employment by december 6, 2016. mr. fiore and ms. jacklin  exchanged several additional follow-up e-mails on december 6, 2016. in one of these emails,  mr. fiore stated that ""i will be back before you know it[,] paula and excited to share it with all of  you!!!"" id. at 2.  on february 1, 2017, mr. fiore sent adam kokas of atlas air group (""atlas""), a major  fdg group client, an e-mail from one of his personal e-mail addresses that invited mr. kokas to  ""grab a cocktail or lunch"" so that mr. fiore could ""fill [him] in on the goings on with [mr. fiore]  and also answer questions you may have!!"" pl.'s ex. 23.  around april 24, 2017, mr. fiore exchanged text messages with larry bates, of apollo  global management (""apollo""), a fdg group client. see pl.'s ex. 25. the following text  message exchanges occurred between the two:  mr. bates: all good - how's business plans going?  mr. fiore: excellent buddy -looking forward to making a huge announcement  soon!! i should have done this years ago bro . . .  . . . .  mr. bates: what's your target date?  17  mr. fiore: i can't say bro but you will know my man  pl.'s ex. 25 at 1-2. at the hearing, mr. fiore testified that mr. bates is not on the retirement plan  board at apollo and that defendants had excluded apollo from being solicited by procyon.  mr. fiore's testimony also indicated that, following ubs's termination of his  employment, he reached out to around fifteen to twenty fdg group clients for whom he had  been the lead contact, to explain what had happened. to his knowledge, the fdg group was not  aware of these communications.  v. other communications  on may 26, 2017, mr. farrar sent the other protocol defendants, mr. fiore, and mr.  foster an email discussing the preparation of protocol lists for the protocol defendants. see  email, pl.'s ex. 5. five pdf documents were attached to the email, containing different lists of  client information that the group was working from. mr. fiore testified that he did not reply to  provide feedback because he had no relevant data at that time.  b. the protocol defendants  the court finds that, with regards to the protocol defendants, the evidence clearly  establishes that they, particularly mr. farrar, were working with mr. fiore prior to june 2, 2017  to establish the new entity that became procyon.  mr. fiore's testimony and the evidence of mr. fiore's communications, particularly those  with ms. disbrow and dr. aledort, shows that, as early as february 28, 2017, mr. fiore had  already given mr. farrar a ""huge amount of responsibility in building our new operation."" pl.'s  ex. 22 at 11-17. by march 3, 2017, mr. fiore was already working with mr. farrar and the  other protocol defendants to set up the entity that became procyon, including by searching for  real estate for the new office. pl.'s ex. 17.  18  on may 26, 2017, mr. farrar sent the other protocol defendants, mr. fiore, and mr.  foster an e-mail discussing the preparation of protocol lists. see e-mail, pl.'s ex. 5. mr.  farrar's e-mail attached five pdf files, which were (a) one protocol list of institutional clients  that the protocol defendants were planning to include on their protocol lists; (b) one ubs copy  of the same list, which had account numbers; (c) one protocol list of private clients that the  protocol defendants were planning include on their protocol lists; (d) one ubs copy of the same  list, which had account numbers; and (e) a list of institutional clients that were removed and that  ""should not be listed on any sheet we are turning in and won't go further than here.""7 id. the  court finds that this evidence shows that, at least on this occasion, the protocol defendants sent a  ubs file containing confidential client information, in the form of account numbers, to mr.  fiore, who had been terminated from ubs.  mr. farrar's may 26, 2017 e-mail included a few comments of particular relevance:  please review this list. it is compiled from the data you provided me. if there are  an errors no matter how small lets fix so we don't give ubs any stupid reason to  object.  . . .  i sorted the [private client] list by zipcode just to fuck with them a little. it's the  small things....  email, pl.'s ex. 5.  mr. minerva indicated that he learned that,8 on june 1, 2017, the day before the protocol  defendants resigned from ubs, they ""informed the fdg group support staff that they would be  having a team bowling event."" minerva aff. &para; 55. instead, the protocol defendants actually  brought the fdg group support staff ""to procyon's office and solicited them to join"" procyon.  7 the list of institutional clients that were removed was in the form of an e-mail chain including a forwarded e-mail  from mr. foster's gmail account, dated may 24, 2017. mr. fiore's testimony noted that the clients on this list were  removed from the protocol defendants' proposed protocol lists because they were clients that had not been referred  by fdg group members.  8 mr. minerva's affidavit does not indicate how he learned this information, or from whom. see minerva aff. &para; 55.  19  id. among the fdg group support staff that had been at ubs, mr. foster, robert ossers, and  richard appaluccio also resigned from ubs to join procyon. id. &para; 56. at the hearing, ms.  giordano testified that she was among the employees defendants approached and that she, in  fact, joined procyon at its inception and worked there for several days, though she then returned  to ubs. defendants admit that a june 1, 2017 event occurred, but dispute that this event violated  relevant non-solicitation provisions. see farrar decl. &para; 21, ecf no. 45 (""we invited the staff of  the fdg group to a social event on the evening of june 1, 2017. we disclosed our plans to  resign the next day and we explained we were launching procyon. we did not solicit them to  come . . . . some indicated they wanted to join [procyon]. they were asked to sign statements  confirming they were not solicited."").  2. june 2, 2017 announcements  on june 2, 2017, the day that procyon opened for business, mr. fiore's procyon email  address sent out an e-mail blast with the subject line, ""exciting news: the team of fdg group  is now procyon partners"" (the ""blast e-mail""). blast e-mail at 1, ecf no. 1 ex. j. this e-mail  was signed by defendants and mr. foster, as partners of procyon. id. at 2-3. around this time,  procyon also sent a hard copy mailing that included a cover letter that was essentially identical to  the blast e-mail (the ""letter"" and collectively, the ""announcements"") as well as account transfer  paperwork and documents that included some personal identifying information. supp. minerva  aff. &para; 4, ecf no. 18; see also letter, ecf no. 18 ex. a. the hard copy mailing also included  ""account transfer forms and promotional materials about procyon, among other things.""  minerva aff. &para; 7.  20  a. recipient lists  the testimony at the hearing showed that defendants sent the blast e-mail to roughly  1600 email addresses. testimony at the hearing also showed that defendants sent the letter to  roughly 300 private clients from the fdg group, out of the total of roughly 500 or 600 fdg  group private clients. mr. farrar's testimony admitted to some oversights by defendants in their  preparation of the announcements' recipient lists, which led to the inclusion of at least some  contacts that defendants did not intend to solicit.  mr. farrar testified that defendants did not use the protocol lists when sending the blast  e-mail, instead they used the protocol lists to help compile a distribution list, using a software  called vestorly. they then used those distribution lists to send the blast e-mail.  on may 10, 2017, as part of the planning process for the blast e-mail, mr. farrar sent the  other defendants and mr. foster an e-mail attaching a spreadsheet of email addresses that they  planned to send the blast e-mail to (the ""spreadsheet""). pl.'s ex 6 at 1. the spreadsheet had  two tabs, the first for ""clients"" and the second for ""cois"" or ""centers of influence.9 mr.  farrar's testimony at the hearing indicated that the centers of influence tab was for adding  friends and family and others that defendants wished to notify. his testimony further indicated  that the 1600 e-mail addresses that ultimately received the blast e-mail included both the people  listed under the clients tab and the centers of influence tab. the spreadsheet was not yet in its  final version, and mr. farrar's e-mail asked the others to continue ""filling this out separately""  before mr. farrar would send it to mr. foster to compile it.  9 one issue that ubs raised at the preliminary injunction was that the defendants had, up to july 17, 2016, the date  of the preliminary injunction hearing, refused to produce the centers of influence tab of the spreadsheet as part of  discovery in this case. as part of ubs's request for injunctive relief, it is requesting that the court order defendants  to produce the centers of influence tab to them, so that ubs can determine if defendants have, in ubs's view,  wrongfully contacted any other clients that ubs is not yet aware of.  21  mr. farrar testified that the blast e-mail was sent to at least one individual from satterlee  stephens, a fdg group institutional client that was not on the protocol lists. he further testified  that the blast e-mail was also sent to at least one individual from dxl group, a fdg group  institutional client that mr. farrar had previously listed as an institutional client that should be  excluded from the protocol lists. the dxl group representative responded favorably to the  blast e-mail and set up a meeting with mr. gahan and mr. gloria. mr. farrar also testified that  at least one individual from apollo had received the blast e-mail, though, as mr. fiore also  testified, apollo was one of the fdg group institutional clients that procyon intentionally  excluded from the protocol list. procyon representatives have scheduled a meeting with apollo.  as for the letter recipients and private clients, mr. farrar's testimony showed that at  least some of the recipients of the letter were private clients who were introduced by fdg  group members who remained at ubs, including ron edelstein, a client of mr. gaugler.  b. announcement contents  the first paragraph of the blast e-mail explained the following to recipients:  we're writing to share exciting news about the launch of our new firm, procyon  partners. we are now an independent, employee-owned financial advisory firm  registered with the sec. drawing upon our years of experience and broad  expertise, we will continue to serve our clients through a dual focus on [the  private wealth management business and the institutional client business].  blast e-mail at 1. the e-mail goes on to note that, ""[w]ith our firm's two complementary  practices, the name procyon perfectly reflects the long, proud tradition of our founding partners  who have helped people along their financial journey for more than 20 years."" id.  the e-mail went on to inform recipients that ""[o]ur team will be reaching out to you in  the coming days to discuss any questions you may have about this change, including details  about the smooth transition of your accounts to our new custodian partner, schwab advisor  22  services, if applicable."" blast e-mail at 2. it further notes that ""[w]hile this is a significant  change for our firm, what's most important is what won't be changing: our passionate  commitment to serving you."" id.  3. communications after june 2, 2017  ubs's motion for a preliminary injunction alleged that defendants also made various  communications after june 2, 2017 that misrepresent procyon and the status of the fdg group.  see pl.'s br. at 12-13. the court finds that much of the evidence that ubs attached to their  motion to support these allegations is hearsay evidence that, while admissible in the court's  consideration of a preliminary injunction motion, is ultimately unpersuasive and inconclusive.  see mullins v. city of n.y., 626 f.3d 47, 52 (2d cir. 2010) (noting that ""hearsay evidence may be  considered by a district court in determining whether to grant a preliminary injunction"" and that  the fact that evidence is hearsay ""goes to weight, not preclusion at the preliminary stage"");  country fare llc v. lucerne farms, no. 3:11-cv-722 (vlb), 2011 wl 2222315, at *9 (d.  conn. june 7, 2011) (noting that ""[c]ourts have wide discretion to assess the affidavit's  credibility and generally consider affidavits made on information and belief to be insufficient for  a preliminary injunction"" and rejecting a declaration as ""unpersuasive"" because it ""was made on  unidentified and unsubstantiated information and belief and not on . . . personal knowledge"");  mullins v. city of n.y., 634 f. supp. 2d 373, 384 (s.d.n.y. 2009), aff'd, 626 f.3d 47 (2d cir.  2010) (""the court may consider hearsay evidence in a preliminary injunction hearing.  nevertheless, a court may weigh evidence based on whether such evidence would be admissible  under the federal rules of evidence."" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  23  ii. discussion  because defendants received notice and participated in an adversarial hearing on ubs's  motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, ecf no. 3, the court  treats ubs's motion as a motion for a preliminary injunction. see genworth fin. wealth mgmt.,  inc. v. mcmullan, 721 f. supp. 2d 122, 125 (d. conn. 2010) (treating application for temporary  restraining order as motion for preliminary injunction). the standards for entry of a temporary  restraining order and a preliminary injunction are identical. see andino v. fischer, 555 f. supp.  2d 418, 419 (s.d.n.y. 2008) (""it is well established that in this circuit the standard for an entry  of a tro is the same as for a preliminary injunction."") (gathering cases). ""a party seeking a  preliminary injunction must demonstrate: (1) either (a) a likelihood of success on the merits or  (b) sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation and  a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in the movant's favor and (2) irreparable harm in the  absence of the injunction."" faiveley transp. malmo ab v. wabtec corp., 559 f.3d 110, 116 (2d  cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  the parties agree that the subject matter of this case is subject to finra arbitration.  nonetheless,"" the expectation of speedy arbitration does not absolve the district court of its  responsibility to decide requests for preliminary injunctions on their merits."" am. exp. fin.  advisors inc. v. thorley, 147 f.3d 229, 231 (2d cir. 1998)  a. likelihood of success on the merits or sufficiently serious questions going  to the merits  before a district court may grant a preliminary injunction, the party seeking it must  demonstrate either one of ""(a) a likelihood of success on the merits or (b) sufficiently serious  questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardships  tipping decidedly in the movant's favor."" faively transp., 559 f.3d at 116.  24  ubs moves for injunctive relief based on all counts in its complaint. see motion at 2,  ecf no. 3. the complaint brings claims for alleged breach of contract by mr. fiore, compl. &para;&para;  48-51; alleged breach of contract by mr. farrar, mr. gloria, and mr. gahan, id. &para;&para; 52-55, alleged  misappropriation of trade secrets under cutsa by all defendants, id. &para;&para; 56-62; alleged  violations of cutpa by all defendants, id. &para;&para; 63-67; mr. farrar, mr. gloria, and mr. gahan's  alleged breach of fiduciary duties that they owed to ubs by allegedly collaborating with  procyon prior to their resignation from ubs, id. &para;&para; 68-73; and alleged unfair competition by  defendants, id. &para;&para; 73-75.  as ubs clarified at the hearing, its request for relief is focused on the following  categories of allegations, (1) that mr. fiore is not protected by the protocol and remains bound  by non-solicitation provisions of his agreements with ubs, both points that defendants  conceded at the hearing; (2) that mr. fiore has made various communications to present or  former fdg group clients, both before and after the june 2, 2017 opening of procyon, that  constitute solicitation and therefore violate his non-solicitation obligations, which defendants  dispute; (3) that the protocol defendants had been collaborating with mr. fiore prior to their  june 2, 2017 resignations from ubs and that they therefore violated fiduciary and other duties to  ubs, which defendants dispute; and (4) that after the protocol defendants resigned from ubs  on june 2, 2017, procyon made certain communications to clients that they did not include on  their protocol lists, which violates the protocol and justifies the court imposing injunctive relief  as to the protocol defendants, which defendants also dispute.  for the reasons discussed below, the court finds that ubs has shown a likelihood of  success on the merits as to mr. fiore violating his non-solicitation agreements. the court also  finds that ubs can show neither a likelihood of success on the merits, nor sufficiently serious  25  questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation as to the protocol  defendants, because of the protocol. as will be explained below, because the court ultimately  finds that ubs will not be able to show irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction and the  court will therefore not grant its motion for a preliminary injunction.  1. mr. fiore  at the hearing, the parties agreed that the protocol does not apply to mr. fiore, and also  agreed that he is governed by non-solicitation obligations arising from his agreements with  ubs.10 thus, the only issue that remains for the court as to mr. fiore is whether any of his  communications with fdg group clients rose to the level of solicitation and therefore violated  his agreements with ubs.  mr. fiore's transition agreement defined ""solicit"" as communicating in any way with a  client that ""may have the effect of inviting, encouraging or requesting a client"" to (a) ""transfer  his/her [ubs] accounts to [mr. fiore] or his/her new employer"", (b) ""open a new account with  [mr. fiore] or his/her new employer"", or (c) ""otherwise discontinue his/her existing business  relationship with [ubs]."" fiore trans. agr. &para; 5, ecf no. 1 ex. a.  courts have found that a defendant breaches their non-solicitation agreement when  sending an announcement that announces their new firm and their particular expertise to a  targeted recipient list that includes clients from their former firm. see marsh usa inc. v.  schuhriemen, 183 f. supp. 3d 529, 536 (s.d.n.y. 2016), amended, 2016 wl 2731588";Q

(those numbers are well within the margin of error, though- could just be noisy data.)  2. los angeles    my hometown has become an unlikely poster child for the urban affordability crisis sweeping the country. tens of thousands of new residents are flooding the city every year, and housing additions have been uneven. dwellability has increased every year since 2013, though-if that trend line continues, there could be enough new units at least for the new folks coming in every year. that doesn't mean the end of the housing shortage, though: there are still years of latent demand to account for.     3. san antonio    though it slowed considerably in 2016, san antonio's growth has been explosive in recent years, and it's begun to grapple with an affordability crisis. from the looks of it, housing has not not begun to catch up.  4. new york city    new construction in the big apple boomed in 2014, thanks to a wave of new luxury developments. that settled down in 2015, but building permits also surged that year. the numbers aren't in the census for 2016, but other sources show that the city was actually able to build or preserve an impressive 22,000 affordable apartments that year. meanwhile, new york's population growth has slowed way, way down-it's pretty alarming to see it charted so clearly here. rents will never be cheap in nyc, but they, too, are falling faster than most of the other primo markets in the u.s. for once, america's biggest city resembles something of a tenant's market.  5. seattle    measuring the rate of growth for the cities on this list, seattle was the second fastest growing big city after phoenix. unlike its sunnier counterpart, seattle is grappling with a major housing crisis as it gains tons of new residents. there are positive signs, though: seattle increased its dwellability considerably in 2015 through a massive rental boom. reports suggest that the trend line will continue in 2016 and 2017. even if many of these new homes are priced for luxury tenants initially, that stock should eventually ""filter down"" over time to meet the needs of lower-income renters. it'll take years, but there could be hope for seattle-ites.  below, check out the next five top-gaining u.s. cities are doing.  6. dallas    dallas' population growth has slowed down, but dwellability ramped up in 2015. home prices are on a steady upwards trajectory.  7. fort worth    fort worth's population gains track closely with dallas', and its dwellability trend line registers a steady increase since 2013.    8. houston    houston saw a big dip in new residents in 2016, but a huge spike in dwellability. is it enough to abate the city's quiet affordability crisis? maybe if construction continues at this pace.  9. austin    texas' most expensive housing market saw new dwellability ratchet up in 2013, but it's declined since. austin is struggling with a severe shortage of affordable housing, but at least these numbers show a closer-than-average match between new residents and new capacity.  10. san diego poor san diego: when it comes to creating housing, america's finest city it ain't. the city seems to have shed units in 2012 (though that loss is well within the margin of error, so this could just be noise), and though it's been adding unevenly since then, it's still losing more affordable homes than it's gaining. meanwhile, new san diegans keep pouring in.  so what's our forecast? many of america's big expensive cities are seeing a rent slowdown, and if some of these reassuring gains in housing capacity continue, perhaps that will continue. the citylab dwellability index is an ongoing experiment in comparing housing growth to population growth, and we'll keep refining it. check out this spreadsheet to see how i got these numbers; and please chime in on how this experiment could work better for the next batch of population numbers.";Q

3480;hobbydb;"whether you're looking for a manual for a vintage car, a video game you used to play with as a child or a list of every product featuring a coca-cola logo, hobbydb is your go-to place to find what you want.

 at the core of hobbydb, our database is the foundation of our integrated website, allowing users to extensively research everything from barbies to matchbox cars and everything inbetween.

 at the beginning of 2017, hobbydb also brought on three additional senior team members, david parker and jud valeski who co-founded and helped successfully exit their businesses, and josh scott, co-founder of the popular ecommerce site, craftsy.

 a passionate and lifelong collector himself, christian began documenting and selling collectibles at a young age and has continued to do so for over 30 years. before founding hobbydb, christian has previously worked for bain & company and ge capital, and was the largest ebay seller in europe.

 in 2014, co-founders christian and andrew decided to move to the u.s. to create hobbydb. as a first step, they assembled an advisory board consisting of the leading experts in the collectible space. with momentum building, the site quickly reached its 2,000th user milestone only one year after launching.

 hobbydb builds on that amazon model by adding the ability for collectors to document what they own and want to own (collection management). hobbydb also integrates that directly into their marketplace, making it possible to list an entire collection for sale in seconds.

 in the fall of 2015, hobbydb hired a third cofounder and head of marketing, alexandra lindsay. alexandra joined after helping to successfully build and exit another techstars company.

 introducing hobbydb: from diecast cars to electric guitars, hobbydb is an amazon-style marketplace powered by a database of every collectible ever made. built for the world's fragmented $ 200 billion collectibles market, hobbydb empowers collectors to research, buy, and sell their collectibles all in one convenient location.

 powered by our unique database, hobbydb's collection management system allows users to upload images and record data about their own collectibles, as well as tracking their wish lists. whether you're interested in selling your items, expanding your collection, or just keeping track of what you already own, our easy-to-use online tools are what collectors need to keep everything straight, all in one place.

 after speaking to more than 4,000 collectors, the hobbydb team has put the time, effort, and care into getting to know our customers and their interests -- which is why our interface directly meets their unique needs across all the key areas of the collector's pyramid: researching, managing your collection, and buying/selling.

 hobbydb's marketplace is specifically designed with the collector in mind. whether you're on the market to buy or sell collectible items, hobbydb's versatile marketplace lets you easily find what you want to buy or sell using the database, receive alerts when items come on sale and sell with just a few quick clicks, exponentially faster than any freeform marketplace.

 in the summer of 2015, hobbydb graduated from the techstars accelerator program, giving the company access to valuable mentorship, publicity and investment.

 since launching in 2014, hobbydb has won over more than 120,000 collectors. in the last twelve months our monthly visitors grew by more than 17x and the number of items in our users' collections grew by 88x.

 since starting his own collection at age 7, hobbydb ceo christian has dreamt of creating the ultimate site for collectors, one which documents the entire history of every type of collectible and provides an online haven for them to carry out all their collecting activities in one place. now, with the help of an innovative and dedicated team of business professionals and collectible enthusiasts, hobbydb is now the fastest growing collectible marketplace on the web.

 hobbydb is already quickly becoming a staple for the collecting industry, and is dedicated to constantly improving our services. pipeline developments include:

 adding millions of data donations: hobbydb has received more than 1 million data donations (such as around 100 books about collectibles that can be digitized) and counting! we plan to scale our data team and data import technology in order to help add this data as quickly as possible, without sacrificing its accuracy.

 partnering with more brands to bring in even more data: in addition to creating official archives for brand partners, hobbydb has been asked to build an api to help integrate partner databases/marketplaces, into the hobbydb ecosystem.

 at the end of 2015, hobbydb integrated the web's largest hot wheels database, tripling their base traffic. in 2016, hobbydb accelerated the growth of the catalog to more than 275,000 database entries and integrated data from more than 30 popular collectible brand partners including kidrobot, matrix scale models and minichamps.";X

3525;gopuff; 1. consumer-centricity  by embracing innovations in self-service and personalization, today's leading brands have put consumers in control of their individual retail experiences. it's a subtle detail, but it matters. consider the experience found at many qsrs and coffee shops. you wait either wait in line or sit through unpredictable--and sometimes lengthy--drive-thrus, only to have the experience conducted and facilitated by an employee who functions as a sort of gatekeeper. even some big box retailers continue to operate from this perspective. how many of us have walked into a store only to be pestered within seconds--by multiple employees--who ask if they can help us find something? but when i walk into convenience retailers like ricker's, wawa, quiktrip and sheetz, it's clear that the customer is in control. at ricker's, i order customizable tex-mex fare via touchscreen, and i make my own coffee using high-quality, automated machines from franke and schaerer. do i want frozen yogurt? it's self-serve too. even the design and layout of the store facilitates a self-directed experience. it's fast, it's convenient and it accommodates individual preferences. while customers do have to wait on an employee to pay for their purchases, that's a minor detail. the point is that consumers are in charge. employees simply enhance the experience with customer service as needed. 2. differentiation  in the past, many convenience retailers offered the same basic products with little differentiation. although some have continued to operate this way, today's leading stores and brands have set themselves apart with unique offerings--especially in foodservice. not only do brands like sheetz, rutter's, and maverik differentiate themselves this way, but many independent retailers do so as well. the 36 lyn refuel station in minneapolis, mn offers a wide variety of locally-produced beverages and snacks, and the high country market and gastropub in round rock, tx offers wine tastings, unique craft beers, and a range of food with such attention to detail that black truffle oil is used in the homemade ketchup. unique offerings matter. the promise of many potentially-disruptive newcomers--such as bodega and gopuff--is quicker, more convenient access to packaged beverages, snacks, and small groceries. to get a slice of casey's pizza or a wawa gobbler, however, you have to visit one of their locations. as an added convenience, however, wawa offers does offer delivery via grubhub in select locations, and casey's fans can order pizza delivery through their mobile app. 3. something for everyone  as i explained in an upcoming episode of convenience matters, providing healthful options isn't about excluding the indulgent products--but rather offering something for everyone. it's a way to broaden your customer base. this is especially important since 93% of americans live less than 10 minutes from a convenience store, and half of americans already visit them daily. from what i've seen visiting stores around the country, however, 2017 has been a good year for consumers who want healthful, on-the-go options. more often than not, i'm able to find something when i step inside a convenience store--even if it's as simple as mixed nuts and an apple or banana. in the case of leading retailers like kwik trip, the healthful choices are far more plentiful.;X
3535;bombfell;" emily gould and rumaan alam nyt syndicate as so many emotional journeys do, this one began with me expressing disgust on twitter. in this instance, i was angry about the proliferation of lifestyle-touting subscription clothing services. i'd recently seen ads for bombfell on the subway (""if shopping isn't your bag, you're going to love our box"") and hit a personal tipping point.

  clothing delivery services seem somehow dystopian, and although i was freaked out by them, i didn't fully understand why. twitter people rushed to fill me in, as i'd hoped they would. clothing subscriptions provide a utilitarian uniform for cubicle-bound automatons, people said. they enforce a kind of fascistic conformity, like mao suits but more cheaply made and less chic. they infantilise us in the same way that meal kit delivery services do: by replacing labour done by someone who might care how we're fed or what we're wearing (say, a loving parent) with labour done by workers at the bottom rung of a startup, or even maybe by an algorithm designed to take keywords and turn them into outfits. it sounded so much worse than i'd even imagined, and of course this made me want to find out more. so rumaan alam and i decided to make ourselves his 'n' hers guinea pigs in a harrowing experiment: together, we would try out the experience of several of the most popular subscription services. we would take notes on our experiences and compare them. in doing so, we would learn a truth. are clothing subscriptions the soylent of fashion "" or are they maybe just a fun and convenient new way to shop? rumaan: my first subscription was to bombfell, the ubiquitous instagram advertiser that sounds like a roger moore-era bond film. the enrolment process emphasises the user over the clothing; you describe your body type, your general style, and indicate anything you know you have no interest in, like boot-cut jeans or graphic tees. i am someone who is interested in fashion, which doesn't put me outside bombfell's target demographic, because what the company sells is something i'm interested in too: ease. i appreciate that the delivery was fast and the customer service attentive. the pricing was not an issue because you pay only if you keep the clothes bombfell sends you and i returned everything. in my enrolment, i told bombfell that i was simply too busy to shop, that i had a modern sense of style. they sent me a long-sleeve tee, a chambray shirt, a pair of brown pants and a pair of faded black jeans, all perfectly serviceable. this was more like the clothing a mother might choose for an adult son, rather than what i expect from a stylist, even if that's just a term of art for a customer service representative.  especially galling, i thought, was the long sleeve tee, which bombfell assured me was a design that was theirs alone. exclusivity is meant to be alluring, but it's hard not to reason that per some arrangement, every customer, no matter his style or needs, is going to be sent this particular garment. part of this site's appeal is, i think, its prices, but i refuse to pretend that $68 is a fair price for a cotton tee. emily: i started with le tote because i get served its instagram ads most often, and because one twitter dissenter had mentioned finding it useful when starting a new job. all the options it showed for outfits you would potentially wear seemed irretrievably wack to me, but le tote does allow you to choose what's in your shipment from a set of options, to which it adds a few""fun"" extras. my first tote contained a striped shirt, a faux suede moto jacket, a pair of leggings with nike written up the side, and (fun!) a vending-machine-quality ring and a floral scarf. the whole thing cost $147, if i wanted to buy it all, which i did not; $147 seemed expensive, considering the plastic fast-fashion quality of the clothes in it. rumaan: stitch fix is in the business of style more than convenience. the style questionnaire is more rigorous than bombfell's, more granular, and i could imagine my fellow consumers answering those queries mindful of what the right articles of clothing might do for them. i requested some blazers. i was sent two, both perfectly serviceable if not quite what i want in a blazer. the trade-off for the convenience of trying something on at home is that you don't have access to much variety. presumably, over time, your stylist (or the algorithm) will learn to anticipate your tastes, the way we're told online advertising works. my friend tried on one of the blazers and declared that he wanted it. it was only when i pointed out that it was $200 that he noticed that the shoulder didn't fit quite right, that the cut was not altogether flattering. emily: i next tried trunk club women, also based on twitter recommendation "" this one from a woman who swore that the app's stylist had heeded her very specific requests and that she'd ended up buying several of the items from her first trunk. unlike le tote, trunk club is expensive. you also get to have a chat with a person who is definitely not a bot about your style preferences. i actually loved this process so much. doubters (like rumaan!) told me,""well, you could have that experience at any department store, especially at nordstrom, which owns trunk club."" but the illusory intimacy of digital interaction made me so much more honest with sophie, the stylist, than i would have ever been with a stranger in real life. very quickly, she learned about me. i admitted that i was unlikely to ever wear anything bodycon and described my ideal aspirational aesthetic as""rich."" the results were so shockingly on point that there were two items in my first trunk preview that i had to delete, not because i didn't like them, but because i already owned them. i kept a soft cropped sweater and a black velvet eileen fisher t-shirt that i wore later that week to a dinner to celebrate my 36th birthday, which seemed appropriate.";X

5271;reelgood;"reelgood declined to say how many people have downloaded and are using its ios app so far, but sanderson there was a spike of a ""few thousand users"" the day it launched; it has grown by about 10% per week ever since.

 reelgood, a startup that's obviously much smaller than apple, is already taking on this big challenge with an app for ios smart-phones that helps its users sort through almost two dozen ott apps and services, including netflix, amazon video and hulu (see sidebar). reelgood will typically list titles that are offered as part of a subscription service ahead of options in which the user must pay extra.

 in addition to movies in theaters, reelgood's con-tent-finding app sources data from almost two dozen apps and digital video services:

 reelgood launched its ios app about four months ago, and has plans underway to expand access to apple tv boxes, android devices and web browsers. the company is still weighing when to move to platforms such as the amazon fire tv and roku players.

 users can also put titles on a watch list, and are alerted when those titles are made available on one of reel-good's supported sources. the app also keeps users apprised of movies and shows that are popular among friends who also use and share data with reelgood.

 ""instead of having to flip across all of those apps at once, reelgood [presents] all of the content that's available to you,"" david sanderson, reelgood's founder and ceo and a former facebook executive, said.

 reelgood, founded last year and run by former executives from facebook, google, twitter and popcorn time, has developed a basic algorithm that looks at the popularity of titles across those apps to list tv shows and movies that a user might be interested in. once selected, the reel-good app (a link to the iphone version is at reelgoodapp.com) automatically directs the user to the appropriate app and starts it up.

 a website version will also launch in a few weeks. sanderson said reelgood was surprised to learn that many users still stream video on laptops connected to big-screen tvs.

 among other early observations, he noted that reelgood is helping consumers unearth content from amazon prime they didn't realize was available. amazon ""has great content, but they haven't done a great job of letting people know what's available,"" he said.

 reelgood is also developing an ad-based business model, as it's the desire of the company to continue to offer the app for free. some ""large streaming providers"" have inquired about advertising opportunities on reelgood, sanderson said, but that the plan is to launch an ad component within a year.

 palo alto, calif.-based reelgood received a $1 million angel investment from michael dearing, founder of harrison metal, and is the process of raising a $2 million convertible note. social capital, storm ventures and correlation ventures are among those participating, sanderson noted.";X

1469;spothero;" technology has already started to solve the problem of squeezing into a space, with automatic parking features taking the pain out of parallel parking. now it is trying to solve the other headache: finding a spot in the first place. a slew of apps can predict where on- and off-street spaces will be available, direct you to them, reserve a space and let you pay for the spot through your smartphone. and manufacturers are beginning to add those capabilities to their vehicles' navigation screens. bmw, one of the first to do so, is making the functionality of the parkmobile app available through the navigation system on many of its 2018 models. the bmw screen shows available garages, and its parknow service allows drivers to reserve a space and, if the garage has contracted for the service, pay through the car. certain garages will allow drivers to scan the app's bar code, using their phones, to open the gate. for those metered parking spaces that have sensors, the car's navigation system asks if you want to start a parking session and then, once that's confirmed, charges for the meter on the screen. beginning next year, parkmobile will also allow drivers to add additional meter time via the smartphone app and pinpoint available meters, said parkmobile chief executive jon ziglar. most vehicles lack extensive integration with parking information, but drivers can easily replicate the functionality with one of the many smartphone apps on the market, including bestparking, parker, parkme, parkwhiz and spothero. which one you choose may come down to the number of parking spaces that any particular app inventories in your city. ""all these apps are pretty similar in features,"" said frost & sullivan consulting firm research manager vishwas shankar. according to frost & sullivan's research, the various parking apps track more than 57 million on- and off-street spaces in the united states and europe, and the apps are used by 30 million people. inrix, a data collection firm that provides traffic data to the federal government and space information to a number of parking apps, us drivers waste 17 hours per year in a search for a space. almost one-third of the drivers surveyed said they had been in a fight over a space in the previous year.  inrix and its competitors combine historical data and real-time information to predict how likely a driver will be to find a space in a garage, and which streets are more likely to have metered parking available during a particular time of day. what inrix doesn't do is let you know that a particular parking meter is available. the problem with such granular information is that it's accurate only for a minute or two at best, before someone else grabs the spot. inrix accumulates street parking data based on historical parking trends by day and time, cost and available hours. in addition, it is starting to receive information from cars that have ultrasonic sensors; as they pass an empty space, that information is relayed to the cloud and aggregated to generate parking patterns "" which may already be known to residents in densely populated cities such as manhattan. waze, the crowdsourcing navigation app, uses inrix and other data sources as it enters the""initial stages"" of integrating parking information, said fej shmuelevitz, the company's business development manager. the app can suggest available parking garages near a driver's destination, with information that is updated based on user input. waze is also looking to provide parking information that can be sorted based on price, with the ability to pay for parking through the app. waze envisions street parking information that uses a vehicle's sensors and cameras to find free spots. here technologies, a mapping and traffic data analytics service owned by audi, bmw and daimler, expects to release its parking data feature next year, said helmuth ritzer, the company's vice president of connected vehicle services.

1669;feex;"feex launches new product to help financial advisors comply with the new department of labor fiduciary rule regarding 401k rollovers and ira transfers

  feex, the leader in automated financial account analysis, today announced it's bringing its core analysis capabilities to the financial advisor market.  the new product, feex for advisors, is now being used by fortune 100 financial services companies to assist with compliance of the new department of labor (dol) fiduciary rule.

 'the feex for advisors platform automates and streamlines compliance processes thereby saving financial advisors valuable time which allows them to focus their efforts where they are truly needed, helping customers,' said yoav zurel, ceo of feex. 'the dol rule specifically outlines a prudent process to be followed by financial advisors, but the definition of prudent has changed.  the process begins with a detailed and accurate analysis of an investor's current account, which calls for documents that are often times hard to find and even harder to digest and analyze.  these documents can be up to 150 pages long and in various formats which can take hours upon hours of reading, analyzing and cross-referencing.'

 how feex saves time, and time is money: the 404a5 participant fee disclosure document is referenced by the dol in the fiduciary rule as the document required for a diligent and prudent analysis. the rule specifically highlights retirement plan distributions such as a 401k rollover or ira transfer. feex automatically collects and analyzes the 404a5 participant fee disclosure document as one of its main data sources and runs a detailed analysis on an investor's existing account, taking into consideration the investor's specific plan and holdings. this type of detailed analysis could take a veteran advisor days to complete. the platform allows for a side-by-side comparison of fees, features, past returns and asset allocation against a model portfolio or personalized portfolio. it can be white labeled and deployed in a matter of minutes.

 feex customer and financial advisor sean curley, cfp with the retirement planning specialists, llc, commented, 'feex for advisors is the only solution i've seen that provides the data i need to make a thorough analysis of qualified plan rollovers. it's already been a huge timesaver in light of the dol rule and belongs in the toolbox of every advisor.'";X

1752;sipphone;we also have a proprietary voice system that soonwill reach the end of its life, and we wanted to replace and expandour mobile voice capabilities. we needed toll-quality voice andseamless roaming, especially for nursing and engineering staff.the medical center's pharmacy, dietary, and labdepartments rely on the wireless network for temperature monitoringon 150 devices. we use newbury rfid tags and omnicell medicationand supply-automation solutions to help ensure that medication, labchemistry and food temperatures are in compliance with regulatoryrequirements. in the past, nursing staff had to manually checktemperatures on medication refrigerators, freezers and warmers onevery hospital floor, twice daily.manual checking took more than an hour each time. today, wecentrally monitor all temperature-controlled units and receiveautomatic alerts when temperatures exceed programmedthresholds. meanwhile, our dietary department remotely monitorsrefrigerators and freezers on hospital floors to ensure that icecream, drinks and snacks for patients are maintained at the correcttemperatures. in addition, tgmc's public blood bank drawsblood daily and keeps it at a specific temperature, and thehospital's lab ensures that all temperature-sensitive labtests are monitored. staff members simply go to a web-based dashboard to generatetheir reports in just minutes. our staff estimates that thewireless monitoring saves 700 man-hours per year, and hospitaladministration determined that the savings from wireless monitoringwill pay for the application within two years.we are presently operating a pilot program with nursing staff toreplace more than 300 proprietary wireless phones with handsetsthat operate using session initiation protocol (sip) signaling. sipphones provide us with the traditional calling features of atelephone and enable new features, such as instant messaging,presence and file transfer, as well as the ability to send andreceive multimedia communications such as video andvideoconferencing. when fully implemented, we expect to use about400 sip phones and expand our wireless voice capabilities toengineering and security staff. sip phones will eliminatewalkie-talkies by providing push-to-talk features that willincrease convenience and productivity for these teams. at tgmc, we have few hospital-based physicians, so ourphysicians have their own mobile phones, laptops and pdas. weenable all of our physicians to use their mobile phones on ourwireless network, which allows them to access patient informationand even sign documents in some applications. physicians can usetheir personal mobile phones anywhere in the hospital and timespent walking between floors is often used for dictating notes. thenetwork easily handles everything the hospital staff and patientsneed, and with high performance. the network also supports computers on wheels for nursing staff.today, nurses have the entire day's patient data andmedications at their fingertips, no matter where on the floor theyare working.tgmc's catheterization laboratory also uses the wirelessnetwork to collect electrocardiogram data. technicians with mobilecarts simply push buttons on the ekg unit to download the patientinformation and perform an ekg. data is reconciled automaticallywith the patient's information and delivered wirelessly tothe server, where physicians can review it easily. this applicationoperates seamlessly over the wireless lan and eliminates the needfor technicians to type, which accelerates responsiveness for thecare-giving team.there is a long list of interesting wireless applications thatwe plan to deploy over the next several months to a year, mostlydue to the fact that we now have a virtualized, mission-criticalwireless lan on which we can depend. rfid tags will allow ourpharmacy to pre-program medications and formularies for eachpatient and deliver the information wirelessly to medication carts.this application will help increase productivity and continuouslysafeguard against medication errors.our biomed department soon will eliminate the daily headache oftracking down iv and pca pumps for cleaning. because it isdifficult to find all of the pumps, we have to make sure that thereare many more pumps in inventory than are actually needed, in orderto ensure that enough pumps are available at any given time. wealso plan to extend our rfid tagging to include pumps, so that wecan instantly locate every pump in inventory. this will reduce ourlabor and equipment costs, because we can reduce the number ofpumps needed in inventory. a similar application also will help ussolve another equipment-tracking challenge - missingwheelchairs. now that we have a dependable wireless networkingsystem, our hope is to integrate the tgmc security system withasset-tracking to alert us when a wheelchair is leaving thepremises.we are now in the planning stage of moving our video securitymonitoring from our wired network to the wireless network in orderto gain flexibility and reduce costs. tgmc has several outlyingareas and a parking lot that cannot be monitored because we cannotwire it to our video surveillance system. the cost of deployingfiber to one lot alone is $12,000. with our wireless network-basedvideo system, we can extend our security reach and eliminate thecost of fiber and extra equipment. the network also will allow usto eliminate our current standalone network for video surveillance,as we expect the virtualized wireless lan to easily handlestreaming video communications.literally, the sky is the limit. it's extremely simple toadd applications to this network, which manages everything. as asmall hospital with only two people to manage it, meru'svirtualized wireless lan, the newbury rfid system, andomnicell's solutions enable us to do a lot more -

 esurface is an advanced materials sector company with multiple industry applications. nonetheless, the company is focused on first prosecuting the circuit board (pcb) industry opportunity, before addressing others. currently, the pcb industry predominantly employs a ""subtractive"" manufacturing method, which is highly labor and process intensive, produces poor yields at finer geometries and is limited in shape (flat only) and number of compatible substrates. accordingly, advanced micro-electronics designs are increasingly cost-prohibitive and ""no-bid"" projects are becoming more and more common. the subtractive method is very caustic to the environment and the waste by product is expensive to mitigate. furthermore, an antiquated process makes for a heavily commoditized market with extremely low margins. enter esurface, a fully additive process. manufacturing is simpler and more efficient, with far fewer processing steps. yields are higher, even in multiples, for much finer and far more complex pcb designs. labor usage and space requirements are reduced by multiples. finally, as a result of these improvements, production costs are projected to descend by 50% or more. additionally, esurface enables enhanced signal integrity, due to far tighter tolerances, expanded material selections, allowing plating of circuits on practically any material and shape, including 3d surfaces. also, there is vast improvement in adhesion of metal to substrate and, lastly, important environmental benefits via a closed loop process, radically reducing toxic waste. all of these improvements make for significant advances in microelectronics. the esurface business model is to license its technology to manufacturers for a royalty fee. products / services esurface covaler and process we''re an ip company. we don''t have inventory, per se. we license our patented, covaler-based process to manufacturers for a royalty fee of 5% of their esurface-based production. management chief executive officerdavid benson 23+ years as a corporate turnaround, merger and start-up expert with expertise in fiscal management, licensing, international sales. started career at deloitte touche, specializing in aerospace and defense. director marketing officerrowland hanson former vice president of worldwide marketing for neutrogena corp. recruited by bill gates at microsoft where he was vice president of corporate communications and created and executed branding strategy for ''windows,rdquo; which he named. managing director counsel/legal officerdoug molyneux international corporate lawyer for 25+ years in johannesburg, london, hong kong, and bermuda. most recently, general counsel with amp"";d mobile and assistant general counsel with global crossing. chief technology officerwilliam wismann dr. william e. wismann received his doctorate of science and technology from the international academy of sciences in moscow and has developed, engineered and designed hundreds of products for companies worldwide. he has invented, patented or trade secreted technologies and products in the field of medicine, computers, aerospace, construction materials, automotive, petroleum and chemical industries for over 30 years, and he is the inventor of the esurface technology. he has successfully licensed and transferred technologies globally for over 15 years.";X

2149;ponomusic;"  we also signed an agreement with musical.ly, the fast-growing global social media platform based around video and music with a strong and growing global footprint of over 100m users and we expect monthly revenues from this agreement to increase over time. this agreement and our partnership with will.i.am, who launched his dial wearable ""smartcuff"" device during the period, are examples of how we can leverage our capabilities to enable and participate in disruptive new business models and product categories.  in line with a strategic emphasis on further developing commercial relationships with rights holders, 7digital has reached new agreements with two of the world's major music labels. in addition to continuing to license and provide access to their catalogues for its customers, 7digital will also now provide new services to the labels, which will contribute to the company's revenues for 2016. one contract, negotiated by the new business development team in paris, will see 7digital power a new mobile music service in 4 markets. 7digital will provide a package of services and infrastructure that includes access to the catalogue, front-end and back-end development, reporting, and tools for curation. a second contract, secured by the london business development team, will see 7digital build a new tool for the label relating to streaming.  the merging of radio and music streaming has continued in 2016 and 7digital, with a pedigree in the production of high-quality content for broadcast and extensive experience in streaming, is well positioned to take advantage of this growing trend. during the period we signed a contract with global radio to provide back-end technology and access to the 7digital licensed catalogue of 50 million tracks, and also signed an agreement with german national classical music broadcaster klassik radio to provide the catalogue and mobile app for a new integrated live radio and streamed music service. these wins demonstrate how we can help businesses to take advantage of radio streaming service models to expand reach outside their original country of activity to a potential global audience.  we have also seen strong progress in the provision of high resolution audio in the first half of the year, signing our first contract using the high resolution audio technology, mqa. the contract will see us develop desktop and mobile applications and handle rights holder reporting, end user management and payment processing for a customer which, it is hoped, will launch an mqa service later this year. 7digital will also now be providing the high resolution downloads for neil young's ponomusic platform, following the administration of leading competitor, omnifone.  high resolution audio is an important growth segment within digital music and these contracts, along with others in our pipeline, build upon 7digital's early implementation of mqa download stores in january 2016.  creative  our creative division is engaged in the creation of award winning audio and video programming for broadcasters, receiving commissions from bbc's national radio networks, commercial radio stations and other broadcasters such as sky television. it is a profitable business that brings a number of synergistic benefits to our licensing operations, in particular the ability to offer clients complementary knowledge and skillsets such as playlist curation and video or audio production.  reflecting an expected second half weighting this year, creative revenues in the first half were gbp0.8m (h1 2015: gbp0.9m).  the division has continued to win new business throughout the first six months of this year, benefiting from our broad capabilities and deep industry relationships. we have been contracted to produce content for audible, an amazon company, and have signed a deal with sky arts to produce tv coverage of the cambridge folk festival for the fourth time. continuing our long relationship with the bbc, we have secured a number of contracts in 2016, including retention of the popular sunday morning show and winning the high-profile jazz now series commission (both bbc radio 3). taken together, content produced by 7digital's creative team reaches over 10m listeners every week (rajars q2 2016).  content  content includes legacy sales of digital music downloads by the group direct to consumers; while we remain alert to higher margin opportunities that sit comfortably within our business strategy, this is an activity which we are deliberately decreasing as it is a low margin and non-core to the group.  content revenues in the first half were gbp1.4m (2015: gbp1.1m), benefitting from a contract with a major label to use 7digital's platform for the sales of music downloads direct from an artist's own web-site.  in addition hi-res continued to increase as a proportion of content sales.  strengthened management  7digital has continued to strengthen its management team in 2016, most recently with the permanent appointment of matt honey as chief financial officer. the company also announced the appointment of philippe decottignies to the position of chief technology officer following the acquisition of snowite, and edward kershaw to the role of chief commercial officer. pete downton, previously chief commercial officer, has also been promoted to a newly-created deputy ceo role. all bring significant skills and sector experience and will help drive and manage the group's sustained growth. the group has already seen material benefits from these appointments.  outlook  i am encouraged by the progress we have made and the momentum we have generated in the first half of 2016. the group continues to expand its customer base across an increasing range of geographies and to grow monthly repeat revenues, improving the quality of its business.  the company has a healthy sales pipeline for the second half of the year and the board remains confident of its commitment to achieve profitability by the year end and expects the group to be profitable for the full year 2017.  it is disappointing that, despite this accelerating progress, the provision for revenues owed to us by guvera and slower revenue growth than expected in the first half overall  will result in a larger loss this year than we had anticipated. we continue to expect to be broadly ebitda breakeven in the final quarter of the year.  7digital group plc  financial review";X

 getting a good night's sleep is only truly beneficial if employees are also able to tackle all that comes their way at life and work during the day. to that end, mequilibrium has introduced eight additional skills to meq engage that help individuals thrive in the face of adversity and become more resilient to a number of modern day challenges. these include:";X

2413;webflow;"  webflow is a service that lets users visually create websites, simply by dragging-and-dropping and filling in the blanks where appropriate. today it introduced the ability to introduce engaging animated elements into pages. this can be as simple as a picture that skews its orientation, depending on the position of your mouse, or as sophisticated as an entire scroll-based parallax webpage, where elements strafe onto the screen as you descend towards the bottom.  animations are created through a timeline tool, which specifies what effect or transform should be applied to an element, and the order in which it should happen.  visual web development tools admittedly have a bad name amongst web developers, and justifiably so. some services, like wix and squarespace, lock you into their platform. while you can create a site that looks good and serves a practical purpose, you'll struggle to move your content to another platform, should you wish to. they're a bit like hotel california in that respect; you can check in, but leaving is bloody hard.  other services and tools are known to export questionable code; they may commit the cardinal sins of giving elements undecipherable id and class names, or worse, using inline css to style the page. while you'll be able to manually hack away at the code, it'll be bloody difficult to do.  bryant chou, cto and co-founder of webflow, was eager to stress that this product wasn't like the above, and should be treated as though another abstraction of web development, saying:  ""we're not a squarespace or wix. we're not one of those grandma website builders. we've taken the approach of building webflow as the next visual way to build software. we see ourselves as an abstraction layer on the building blocks of the internet, which are html, css, and javascript.""  in the same respect as there are high-level programming languages and low-level programming languages in systems software, chou looks at webflow as a high-level language for the web. webflow, he said, produces ""semantic code, clean css classes, and doesn't use crazy tables."" he showed me some of the output, and admittedly, it looked pretty clean. ""people take this and use it in react.js apps,"" he said, adding that half of webflow's users identify primarily as developers.  chou also made the argument that this technology makes it easier to be productive. devs can build html5 animations without having to peek into stackoverfow for the correct syntax, or spending hours searching for misplaced semicolons. ""the only thing a designer or developer needs to learn is our ui,"" he said.  ultimately, chou stressed that this tool isn't for merely for casual users (although it's certainly accessible to developers of all calibres), but rather that it can be used to create professional, sophisticated webpages. one impressive demo uses parallax scrolling to illustrate the entire history of the internet. you can check it out here.";X

 policy-based qos. qos is essential for consolidating multiple tiers of workloads onto a single flasharray, or implementing service provider business models. purity's ultra-simple, always-on qos is extended in this release to include sophisticated policy management, which enables customers to define bronze/silver/gold tiers of workloads for worry-free consolidation, or add per-workload limits for service providers to enable differential billing.purity cloudsnap. customers have increasingly leveraged the public cloud for low-cost backup, retention, dr, and to enable agile application development workflows. flasharray introduces purity cloudsnap, a new capability for moving snapshots to and from the public cloud. first, supporting amazon web services (aws), cloudsnap enables snapshot backup to s3 and glacier, with recovery options into ebs or back to flasharray. cloudsnap can restore customer's data in the public using the cloud's native storage formats, which enables full use of public cloud paas services. cloudsnap represents pure's first step to much deeper public cloud integration within purity. snap to flashblade and nfs. purity's snap technology has been greatly enhanced to seamlessly move data copies off flasharray for long-term retention. the feature uses a new portable snapshot format which encapsulates recovery metadata within the snapshot. purity snapshots can now seamlessly be moved to flashblade or any nfs target for long-term retention. the migration and recovery is seamlessly managed within purity's snapshot management policies, which enables snapshot retention on open, lower-cost media options.vmware vvols.  designed for cloud automation, vmware vvols and storage policy-based management bring automation and compliance to vmware-based clouds.  pure's vvols implementation offers new levels of simplicity and hosts the vasa provider right on the flasharray, which enables accelerated vmfs -> vvols conversion, and enabling simple p->v and v->p migrations.purity run. now, pure offers an array that also serves as an open platform to run custom code, extend interfaces, and enable analytic processing to happen where data is stored. purity run enables customers to host vms and containers on the flasharray itself, which opens up new avenues for extensibility and integration. purity run creates a safe, dedicated, performance-and-security-isolated cpu and memory space to run customer code, and supports use cases for edge, remote office, analytic and database appliances.windows file services for purity. many flasharray customers want to consolidate point smb and nfs file shares onto flasharray. purity run now integrates with windows file services (wfs) bringing best-of-breed smb 2/3 and nfs 3/4 protocols onto flasharray. wfs, fully integrated and optimized for flasharray, is fully supported by pure storage, and can be easily managed with the native microsoft management stack.microsoft odx. integration with the offloaded data transfer (odx) api brings fast, transparent, automatic data copy and move services for files and vms, onto flasharray. by offloading the data transfer to the storage array, our odx implementation minimizes latencies, maximizes array throughput, and reduces resource usage such as cpu and network consumption on the host systems.docker persistent volumes. with container technology increasing in mainstream adoption, there is an immediate customer need to deliver persistent storage for containerized applications. with certified docker volume plugin for flasharray, customers can extend the benefits of all-flash shared storage to their new containerized applications. the pure storage integration brings persistent storage to the docker ecosystem that extends to orchestrators like swarm, kubernetes and openshift.compression 2.0. purity//fa 5.0 boosts purity's already market-leading data reduction with an additional 25 percent improvement in compression effectiveness, and further improves all-flash cost efficiency for database and application workloads. all of this is made possible by the introduction of new self-selecting compression algorithms to match the most appropriate data sets.2x performance improvements. purity//fa 5.0 caps off a year of steady improvements in write performance for flasharray, delivering up to a 2x improvement in write throughput, available to all flasharray customers as a simple non-disruptive software upgrade.";X

""existing players like chatfuel or manychat focus on the bot experience, leaving content creators behind,"" he says. ""that's where revoice comes in, to make the process easy. with our automation tool you just tell us what content you have or where to get it, and we will make it look good on messaging apps"".  to add facebook messenger subscription as an option for your newsletter, blog, podcast or youtube channel, you will first need a facebook page for your brand. then it's just a case of signing up to revoice - which has free and paid plans, depending on if you require crm integration and additional pro features - and linking it to your facebook page account.  after doing so, you point revoice to your content sources, such as your email newsletter, and the service takes care of the rest, automatically pushing new content to messenger. you're given a 'subscribe to messenger' widget to post to your blog and your own 'subscribe to messenger' landing page (you can view mine here). revoice also has similar support for chrome, slack and telegram, too.

  the jvm is an integral part of an it system  s java application. java was designed to allow programs to be built once and then run on any platform. jvm makes this possible by interpreting java binary code for various hardware platforms, so that they can perform a java program's instructions. however, enterprise java applications are complex and the jvm hides its memory handling details. improper clean-up of jvm memory can cause the application to slow. as a result, application administrators need to ensure optimal jvm configuration and monitor jvm memory and performance. to simplify this complex process, anturis jvm monitoring allows users to monitor total memory usage, heap, non-heap and pool memory usages, threads and classes of jvms, to ensure the best performance. with anturis jvm monitoring, users can monitor all of their java applications in one web-console. users can also set up warning and error thresholds for each parameter for each java application running in the jvm. anturis provides alarms and notifications to enable system administrators to take corrective actions and improve java application performance. anturis version 2.0 also includes parallels plesk uptime monitor, a new feature of anturis parallels plesk plugin. this new plesk uptime monitor periodically checks if servers are reachable and function properly. users can start basic monitoring of their servers in the parallels plesk panel - even if they don  t have an anturis account. for users who require more advanced monitoring features (including transactions monitoring, email, sms or voice call alerts, reports, detailed graphs, dashboards etc.), they can create an anturis account easily through the plesk panel. users can share server uptime status on their websites via the new anturis uptime widget, which shows website uptime percentage. this widget is a great way for businesses to show their customers that their web service is reliable. it was just over a year ago that we launched the first commercial version of our it infrastructure monitoring solution. since then, anturis has been growing and expanding rapidly. we  ve secured new business partners and thousands of users worldwide,";X

  summary: our business is a start-up company that will initially purchase several profitable laundry operations in the target areas that meet our demographic criteria. see campaign:http://www.equitynet.com/c/laundrymax contact information: chief executive officer - james west

 mr. west experience lies in management and computer software for the internet. mr. west has managed several startup companies involved in internet applications for the web as well as running his own importing business for several decades. he currently owns and manages an art brokerage business as well. he plans on devoting full time to laundrymax after the first of the year.

 laundrymax, inc., is a c-corporation that will be acquiring a chain of full-service laundromats in the south florida metropolitan areas. our business is a start-up company that will initially purchase several profitable laundry operations in the target areas that meet our demographic criteria. we will upgrade these operations to accommodate our plans to market wash & fold services to a more affluent clientele in our region through feeder stores located in upscale neighborhoods and scheduled pick-up/drop-off services by van drivers. we are also developing a mobile software application for smart-phones, tablets, and pc's that will allow easy scheduling and e-marketing of our services to the targeted locales. since most laundromat costs are fixed, (i.e. equipment and rent), the increased utilization of existing equipment and facilities will increase productivity, and also growth in revenues & profits. by upgrading an old and outdated business model for the modern and mobile world we anticipate a growing awareness and utilization of our company and its services. we are targeting an underserved market segment, by outsourcing a time consuming household task, through a reasonably priced and easily arranged service operation. we believe that the combination of an already profitable and well understood business model with a modern, convenient, and reliable service business is a winning combination with substantial growth potential and limited financial risk.

5719;tunespeak;"the african-american families fleeing pruitt-igoe sought housing in st. louis county to the north, in unincorporated towns like spanish lake-and ferguson. other predominantly white suburbs blocked the construction of multifamily housing. so the ring of suburbs outside the city of st. louis all followed their own paths, making up the famously fragmented metropolitan region. the city itself struggled with post-industrial decline and a population-loss spiral of well over a half-million people, and racial divisions were etched into the physical landscape.  today the pruitt-igoe site is once again in the spotlight, but this time because of a new bid to ""get the economic flywheel going in the right direction again,"" in the words of private developer paul mckee, the force behind the proposed northside regeneration project. the rubble-strewn forest is almost exactly at the center of 1,500 acres set for residential, commercial, and office space, plus a school and 50 acres of parks and trails. the lynchpin of it all would be to get the national geospatial intelligence agency-the high-tech eyes and ears of the defense department-torelocate to where the towers of pruitt-igoe once stood.  in classic fashion, there is intense competition for the agency's planned move from its current site next to the anheuser-busch brewery on the mississippi river, with bidders not only in the st. louis suburbs but across the river, in illinois. the super-secure facility wouldn't in itself be great urbanism, but there is little question the agency and its 3,200 jobs would be a catalyst for the regeneration of the rest of the area. st. louis mayor francis slay is pushing hard for the re-use of the site, convinced that a continued economic rebound will be the balm for many of the region's problems. ""i think it does send a message,"" mayor slay says, referring to the current approaches in planning and community development, embodied by the pruitt-igoe redevelopment and northside. ""these are hard issues and they take a long time to address.""  backers of northside point out that st. louis was named to be part of hud's strong cities, strong communities program, where federal agencies offer technical support but let local and regional governments take the lead in what to do with the funding. this is in contrast to the top-down approach of model cities, which led to pruitt-igoe.  northside, however, is squarely in the ""make no little plans"" category of redevelopment. another, more incremental approach can be found several blocks south of the pruitt-igoe site, in the renovated turn-of-the-century garment buildings of washington avenue. there, brian matthews helped closed a deal using historic tax credits to turn the lammert furniture building into a software business incubator called t-rex. what matthews calls an ""entrepreneurship ecosystem"" includes start-ups like tunespeak and less annoying crm. the re-use of the building is the essence of reinvention, with its ideation spaces, satellite offices for area universities, and the inevitable game room.  how much can land-use planning really make things better anyway, given the roiling and deep-seated tensions, mistrust, and unemployment seen in ferguson?  st. louis as a midwest tech mecca alternative to the coasts? demand for housing downtown is soaring, though the quality and quantity of this rebirth is finite. walking through the building, one sees primarily young white males. matthews said t-rex launched a special effort to bring in more women job applicants. ""i'm not sure we're solving that problem,"" he said as we glanced to the latest cnn update on ferguson on the flat-screen tv at the end of our table at over and under bar & grill, on the ground floor.  washington avenue represents another kind of hope for post-industrial cities, a bit more jane jacobs-like-more organic, adaptively re-using a soho-like neighborhood, and in no need of a master plan. it is an example of what my colleague alan mallach, co-author of regenerating america's legacy cities, published by my employer, the lincoln institute of land policy, calls ""strategic incrementalism."" the obvious downside, mallach says, is that st. louis hasn't solved the problem of being more inclusive in its regeneration.  how much can land-use planning really make things better anyway, given the roiling and deep-seated tensions, mistrust, and unemployment seen in ferguson? the only thing the civic leadership can do is soldier on, faced with an array of thread-the-needle challenges: promoting new jobs, but not just jobs for educated white men; big plans and little plans; homeownership and rental opportunities for a range of incomes; and density worthy of good citybuilding, but not too much-somewhere between hope vi and towers in the park.  all the while, another brick drops from a crumbling building on a vacant lot, and the region simmers, in every sense, in the waning days of summer. those trying to calibrate the physical planning and the policy are not unlike an nfl quarterback in the pocket, looking to complete a pass with linebackers charging at them. and with the biggest fumble of all time-pruitt-igoe-in the back of their minds.";X

5747;carsala;" berkeley, calif., feb. 11 /prnewswire/ -- a new used car pricing study released today by carsala.com, an online car buying negotiations service for value-conscious car buyers, found consumers can save, on average, over twenty-five percent off carmax prices through search, analysis, and skilled negotiations. with a tightening used car market and prices expected to remain higher than average, finding the best deal remains a priority for consumers looking for their next used vehicle.

 carsala is privately funded and is financially backed by labrador ventures, launch capital, band of angels and individual investors. for more information about carsala, please visit www.carsala.com.

 the study was completed over a three-week period in january 2010. to view the complete study, carmax pricing study, please contact carsala at press@carsala .com

 the carsala study compared non-negotiable prices at carmax to prices, both pre-negotiated and negotiated, on similar cars at competing dealers. the study provides quantitative evidence suggesting that consumers can find significant savings through non-carmax dealers if they are willing to research, compare and negotiate price.

 carsala releases highlights of used car pricing study; online car buying negotiations service compares prices from used car retail giant carmax and non-carmax dealers to uncover best deals

 carsala analysts randomly selected 20 popular cars and searched for each at carmax.com. they then found similar cars (same year, make, model, and 250 mile radius) at other dealers and negotiated with a subset of those dealers. the carmax prices were then compared to those offered by competing dealers, both before and after negotiations. kelley blue book was used as an equalizer, accounting for differences in attributes like mileage and transmission. finally, autocheck reports were reviewed to control for vehicle quality.

 ""the purpose of the study was to examine used car pricing trends and how car buyers could save money on their next car purchase,"" explained carsala ceo, tyler elliston. ""the results of the study were profound in that not only could car buyers achieve a better sales price by negotiating with non-carmax dealers but they could also save money with simple research and comparison.""

 from the chore-offloading services of taskrabbit and handy to the courier apps of deliveroo and jinn, we exist in a golden age of push-button laziness. but just how useful are these things? and is it possible to get through an entire day without lifting more than a solitary index finger, relying solely on apps to wash, clean, transport, deliver, feed and entertain me? bravely, i slump on to the couch. i'm going to find out.

14795;tracxn;"  in india, paytm made big news worldwide in the year 2015 when china's alibaba opened its wallet to invest over half a billion dollars in it. however, beyond paytm and ever since, the fintechs in india have seen a funding slowdown. as per tracxn, the first half of 2016 saw usd 179 million of funding across 46 new start-ups, which is only 20% of what the area received in the previous half year.  to be successful, there must be constant learning. india has lot to learn from global success (and failure) stories in order to consolidate its position in the global fintech club. fintechs thrive on a tripod with three supporting legs: policy & regulatory support, trust and access-to-data. for example, a fintech can take customers' money only if regulated; customers would entrust their money and personal information only if they trust the fintech, and only access to customer data and information can provide the competitive edge to a fintech.  three key essential lessons india can learn from the global experience around fintech are as follows:  policy & regulation: india must study and adopt the best of regulatory initiatives from the global markets. the securities and future commission of hong kong has set up a fintech advisory group to monitor the risks and regulatory implications of developments in fintech. the us has been consistently easing regulatory barriers to investments, of course with sufficient caution. start-ups in new york are offered 100% tax benefit for the first 10 years. the uk is also providing the strongest regulatory support to its fintech sector through taxation, disclosure mandates, consumer protection regulations and risk management. tax incentives in the uk for fintech are being doubled from 50% to 100% from april 2017.     trust: capgemini's report on fintech's tipping point suggests that consumers, while showcasing more trust in established banks, are more likely to use fintech products once tried. hence, if fintechs can get a platform to clearly demonstrate that they are making things simpler, transparent, easy to use, and cheaper with improved customer experience, they have a good chance of winning the trust of customers. fintechs must move towards simplicity and eliminate confusion. stripe, an irish mobile payment platform valued at usd 5 billion changed its name from ""/dev/payments"" to ""stripe"" and demonstrated how the simplicity of brand name can win trust of customers. london-based transferwise built reliability by beating the opaque transaction and exchange rate pricing of traditional banks with their transparent fees of being ten times cheaper than traditional bank rates.     access-to-data: with advances in machine learning and iot, fintechs are all abuzz with the benefits of big data. in fact, the new wave in information theory and management for the fintech industry is called smart data, i.e., instead of mining infinite irrelevant data sets, smart data focuses on key valuable pieces of information that institutions need. we are seeing a rise in marketplace banks, i.e., traditional banks who have started exposing their apis to third parties for large-scale payments transformation. for e. g. national australian bank opened up its api to cloud accounting firm, xero. as part of the australian government plans to introduce regulations to facilitate the growth of fintechs, productivity commission enquiry has been appointed for enhancing data aggregation, sharing & usage, and regulating open data api.  india needs to also leverage the success stories of other expanding hubs worldwide around the following three key areas - the right ecosystem, collaboration and talent.  ecosystem: there is a need for governments to develop a dynamic digital infrastructure which is adaptable and supportive of the fintech ecosystem. the uk has established itself as one of the most attractive locations in fintech with high digital connectivity. virtual currencies, such as bitcoins have been promoted with tax holidays, while many other countries banned their usage. they have aggressive programs in the uk to address entry barriers by launching research initiatives funding for crypto currency and distributed ledger technology. hong kong invest hkincubator program guarantees loans and marketing grants for smes in the country. australia has announced a formal set of fintech priorities like immediate cash-flow benefits and tax savings. the australian government is also planning to roll-out the national broadband network, to expand its digital infrastructure.  india should work towards higher penetration of mobile, internet and iot infrastructure so that communication and connection is smooth across all channels. the government must provide more incubation support to fintechs. there should be policies helping fintech firms to test and refine their products via robust poc projects with indian financial institutions. similar to shoreditch in london, india should convert unused public/private spaces into incubation centers, thereby creating an environment for start-up community. india should relook and revamp the existing traditional banking models in india and propagate initiatives, such as e-kyc, aadhaar-linked payments, account switching and digital passports.  collaboration: over the past year, there has been a shift as banks have moved from seeing fintech companies as disruptors to co-creators. banks are increasingly collaborating with fintechs to embed new services and technologies that improve customer experience and drive efficiency. international banks, such as citi and global consultants, such as kpmg have set up innovation labs, driving tech innovation in financial services. singaporean bank, dbs, has allocated a sgd 10 million investment into the development of the singapore start-up ecosystem. a uk-israel tech hub has been set-up to share leading technology practices. a lot of international events are regularly hosted in the israel region. the uk and singapore entered into a deal to share and use information on financial services innovation by the uk's fca and singapore's mas.  india should organize international events and invite leaders of start-up companies. this can lead to promotion of the digital capabilities of india, thereby attracting investments. many of the us and uk successful start-ups are expanding geographically. india needs to aid them with an effective policy so that these start-ups can build infrastructure in the country.  talent: universities and public institutions must begin nurturing an entrepreneurial mindset with focus on growing skills and entrepreneurial temperament, leading to an accelerated growth in fintech innovation. hong kong is promoting courses dedicated to entrepreneurship. for 2016-17, hong kong has provisioned for 300 university students to gain overseas exposure in the fintech sector through their cyberport hub. accelerators and incubators are gaining traction in the hong kong region. singapore launched skillsfuture, a national program to up-skill singaporeans on various skills. talent retention is as important as hiring and training to begin with. australia, in their federal budget, announced tax concessions under employee share schemes to help early-stage start-ups retain right talent.  india should build a strong technological and entrepreneurial talent pool by engaging its universities and institutions. academic bodies should be encouraged to act as catalysts towards building an innovative mindset of technological advancement and proto-typing from the very beginning.  the relationship between indian banks and fintech start-ups must strengthen in 2017 and gain momentum by leveraging each other's strengths. a win-win situation needs to be created where both the bank and the fintech start-up stand a chance to prosper together.  before asking what fintech can do for india, let us ask what india can do for fintech!";X

17725;hautelook;" nordstrom rack wasn't always the company's biggest bet. the store began in 1973 as basement-level clearance center in nordstrom's downtown seattle location. as off-price and discount stores became more appealing to consumers in the wake of the 2008 recession, so too did nordstrom rack's appeal. by 2016, rack stores were outpacing full-line stores in terms of growth, and reporting sales increases, while full-line sales slumped. and while growth at rack stores has slowed somewhat, the company's decision to avoid mall locations and instead focus on street-level shops has allowed it to side-step at least one of the thornier problems facing similar large-scale retailers.  the seattle-based retailer is hardly alone in betting on off-price. neiman marcus and saks fifth avenue both have a robust store base in the category and macy's, late to this game, is quickly expanding its new backstage concept with plans for 40 by the end of 2017.  ""our customer loves value and on-trend merchandise. so rack is the number one new acquisition point for customers.""  karen mckibbin  executive vice president, nordstrom rack  in addition to its rack and full-line nordstrom stores, the company operates two jeffrey boutiques, with top-line luxury offerings; two last chance clearance stores, which serve as repositories for whatever doesn't sell through the rack stores; nordstrom.com; nordstromrack.com; online sale site hautelook, which it bought in 2011; and trunk club, a personalized clothing service that operates online and via seven ""clubhouses."" according to mckibbin, all of the company's arms are meant to feed into each other. ""our customer loves value and on-trend merchandise,"" she said. ""so rack is the number one new acquisition point for customers. but we also migrate customers to other channels. customers are shopping high and low.""  rack customers can expect to find the same brands, more or less, that they'd see in a full-line nordstrom - rack proudly and pointedly offers 48 of the 50 brands available at nordstrom's full-line stores. and while no one at the event was able to say exactly which two brands were not available, mckibbin smiled and said, ""i'm sure we're working on them.""  but there's clever bit of wordplay involved in the branding language. just because the brand names match doesn't mean the merchandise is the same. in fact, some off-brand stores such as sak's off 5th report that as little as 10% of its in-store merchandise actually came from saks full-line stores. nordstrom rack does slightly better, confirming to racked that 20% of its product comes from full-line stores. the other 80% is purchased expressly for rack stores.  yet for many customers, that's a technicality that doesn't matter. the store offers impressive designer names, from derek lam and alexander wang to cosmetics from bliss and, most recently, m.a.c., which just a few months ago inked a deal to sell its brand at discounted prices through rack stores. prices range from under $10 for sample-sized cosmetics arranged in sephora-style displays to well over $500 for luxury handbags and high-end designer dresses. two neon ""clear the rack"" signs, hung in street-facing windows, flash when even deeper discounts are available, as a sort of high-end version of kmart's bluelight specials. the store offers free wi-fi and even has on-site tailoring and alterations department to provide fitting services free-of-charge. there are also snacks and soda available for purchase in the checkout line, which blurs the distinction between luxury discount store and basement off-price outlet.  and the formula is working, at least so far. mckibbin said that the company would be opening its first nordstrom rack stores in canada in 2018, in toronto, calgary, ottawa and edmonton. and as far as competitors are concerned? ""we see every store who sells thing as our competitor,"" she says. except, of course, for its full-line stores - the company plans to open a men's store in manhattan in 2018, followed by a flagship women's store in 2019.  expanding at a time when many retailers are looking to contract may be a risky maneuver, but it's clear that the company is betting its combination of retail will find just the right fit with consumers.";X

34659;polyvore;"  co-founder and ceo wes ng shared a few tips on how a hong kong product startup can find global success like casetify. focus on a target demographic profile  co-founder and ceo wes ng started casetify in hong kong to give people the power to express themselves through unique and customizable products.  they began in hong kong in 2011. wes was himself an instagram addict and noticed that after posting interesting pictures, he would receive some engagement but that was the end of it. he then thought, ""wouldn't it be great if we could turn these great photos into real products?"" that's how casetify (then called casetigram) was born.  the decision to start in hong kong wasn't a conscious choice for him. he is from hong kong, so it was quite natural to start there. hong kong is also at the forefront for phones in asia, because they're cheaper to purchase here, so everyone is hyper connected, it's a picture and selfie capital, and most people do require a phone case. hong kong made as much sense as a place to start as anywhere else for casetify, in that regard. benefits of a product company working in hong kong  because of its proximity to china, having a headquarters in hong kong definitely has its perks for physical product-focused companies. they've capitalized on hong kong's unique balance and blend of centralized international asia talent and connections to manufacturing, which is just a short mtr ride across the border.  casetify considers itself a ""full stack"" company, building, branding, manufacturing and shipping its own products. these important business aspects wouldn't cut and paste as neatly into other countries.  leveraging on the power of social media and influencers  they are currently working with many big brands like colette, bbc icecream, lane crawford, hillary duff, karen mok, and fiona sit - but how did that happen? with casetify, it's because many of the celebrities were already using their products and they discovered their product through social media. fans or the celebrities themselves might tag them, in turn allowing them to locate social media savvy celebrities and influencers.  their first customer ever was actually from spain, most likely from a twitter referral. because of their focus on building a fan base on social media, and their instinctively social savvy audience, casetify is used and commented on in social media by people like lionel messi, kobe bryant and snoop dogg. differences in founders from east and west  co-founder and ceo wes ng has had much experience working in many different places and cultures. in fact, casetify probably has more brand recognition in the united states than in asia. i asked him - can the west, hong kong, and asia learn anything from each other?  he says, in terms of startups outside of asia, it's very different. with many friends and frequent visits to silicon valley, he still sees gaps in terms of execution and the openness to discuss ideas. he feels this is especially true in some industries, especially when compared to china where ecommerce is mature and there is a widespread use of mobile payments.  in terms of ideas, he feels people in the east can be hesitant to share their ideas, when we should all be less afraid to do so because an idea is simply the start of something. a company or founder will have 1000 followup ideas or questions that require execution, so execution is actually the most important component to success.  awareness and business growth through niche social media networks  while established social media networks are great to tap into to find fans and build your brand, more niche ones can sometimes be just as valuable.  for example, casetify uses snapchat for many of its events. their staff might provide a sneak peak of an exclusive event, giving a behind the scenes look using snapchat. they also use it and other social media tools to conduct ""flash sales"", where they'll send out a message and the first 50 or 100 customers can get in on a limited time offer, which is an effective way to reach an audience with purchase intent.  other social media platforms they mentioned that are worth investigating in america, which you might not have heard of, are keep, a place to discover and buy the latest trends in fashion, home decor, accessories and design, wanelo, which is a ""mobile mall"", with, surprisingly, over half a million stores and polyvore, a community-powered social commerce website.  it's important to know on a deeper level how users engage on each respective channel. for example, casetify knows that snapchat is an incredible platform for storytelling and uses it for that purpose. the future of product startups?  casetify itself has moved away from having cases as their only product offering (they've recently dived into the world of watch straps), but they stress that it took much planning and time. companies should stay focused and resist the temptation to move too fast into new product categories.  wes believes that the future of retail is an interplay of online and offline. those who understand how retail and e-commerce interact, and how these interactions will affect business, will be the leaders of tomorrow.";X

'we are delighted to partner with payoneer to offer our talented freelancers and entrepreneurs a better way to accept payments from their clients abroad with greater ease. we look forward to seeing them avail the convenience and security afforded by our platforms and grow their businesses globally,' he added.

 payoneer, an innovative cross-border payments company transforming the way businesses pay and get paid globally, announced today that it has partnered and integrated with ez cash, sri lanka's leading mobile money network and a brand of the dialog axiata group, which commands 50% of the country's mobile market.

 payoneer's direct business general manager eyal moldovan said: 'we are delighted to partner with ez cash to further localise our cross-border payment solutions for the sri lankan market and are committed to partnering with additional mobile payment networks and ewallets throughout the world. alliances such as this further cement our position as the go-to solution for freelancers and small businesses, empowering professionals and business owners worldwide to get paid globally as easily as they do locally.'

 through the integration, sri lankan entrepreneurs, merchants and freelancers are able to withdraw cross-border payments they receive using payoneer straight to their ez cash mobile accounts, where they can make a host of local payments with greater ease. the partnership marks another step in payoneer's roadmap to make payments for smbs more seamless, flexible and more localised than ever before. ez cash will market payoneer to its small business customers as a value-added service.

 the integration enables ez cash's 14 million subscribers to leverage payoneer's cross-border capabilities to connect with marketplaces and clients worldwide. ez cash customers can send and receive funds across the network's user base, receive inward remittances from abroad, make online purchases and settle utility bills directly from their mobile phone.

 zoox's spokesman (it has one of those now, too) did not respond to requests for comment on its funding plans, or recent hiring activity.

 having the backing of at least one mega-corporation like tencent (potentially two, if the softbank talks amount to anything) will be important. because zoox will certainly need a lot of money to fulfil its lofty goals.

 executives at entertainment shopping, the german company that runs swoopo, counter that the auctions are fun and challenging while offering the possibility of a killer deal.

 last month, carolyn parslow, who manages a flea market in trumbull, ohio, won a new refrigerator on swoopo for $9.66 - plus the $61.80 she spent on bids. but she sounds a note of caution, saying that she has lost far more auctions than she has won, and that there does not appear to be a way to gain a persistent edge over rival bidders.

 swoopo avoids fraud by selling all of the products itself, often shipping them directly from suppliers. bidding starts at zero, and players can bid up the auction price only in small set increments, like one, two or six cents. swoopo also offers its own automated bidding tool on the site, called bid butler. there is no possibility that users can ''snipe'' an auction at the last moment, because a few seconds are added to the clock with every new bid.

 nevertheless, swoopo's unique spin on the internet auction appears to be suddenly in vogue. this spring, august capital, a silicon valley venture capital firm, invested $10 million in entertainment shopping, financing its expansion to the united states.

 competing bidders spent a cumulative $2,337 in their losing effort to buy the $1,498 refrigerator, for example. swoopo says it must spend much of that revenue to advertise the auctions and attract customers to the site. the company says it had 2.5 million visitors in july, double the number it had a year earlier, and a total of 2.5 million registered users.

 that, incidentally, creates the impression of swoopo auctions that are about to end but last for hours more, a feature of the site that critics say is subtly misleading.

 i. nelson rose, a consultant to the gambling industry and a professor at whittier law school, said u.s. government regulators would probably evaluate swoopo and its ilk not as games of skill or luck, but as auction sites. in that respect, he said, the law on the topic is somewhat gray.  ''it turns out the idea of paying for bids does not seem to be specifically allowed by states, as it is in most of europe,'' mr. rose said. ''but it doesn't seem to be explicitly prohibited, either.''

 ''in aggregate, consumers trying to obtain these products are overpaying,'' said glen whitney, a mathematician and a former quantitative analyst at the hedge fund renaissance technologies, who was asked to evaluate swoopo. ''unless you have an edge over other people who are bidding, and you can get them to subsidize your purchase, you shouldn't do it. it's a chump's game.''

 mr. marchevsky argues that winning on swoopo requires dexterity and patience  - players must know when an auction is likely to end, so they can allocate their time and money. and they should never bid if they are not serious about prevailing.

 but there's a catch, of course: swoopo users are charged 60 cents every time they bid, and those charges add up fast.

 swoopo recently acknowledged that one aspect of the game is not much fun: spending money to bid on products that someone else wins. last month the site began allowing users to apply that money toward buying the product at full price. swoopo's retail prices are marginally above those offered by sites like amazon.

 in that regard, the company behind swoopo is not taking chances, retaining a well-known gambling lawyer, anthony cabot of the las vegas law firm  lewis and roca, as an adviser.

 in addition to a growing number of small swoopo imitators with names like gobid and rockybid, another startup, project fair bid, has raised $4.5 million from three u.s. venture capital firms and plans to unveil its site next march.

 these critics also say that players face long odds in swoopo's auctions, where they must compete against people in the united states, britain and germany. and they note that swoopo is making a nice profit on each item when all the bidding fees are tallied.

 nick marchevsky, a 27-year-old unemployed designer from sewell, new jersey, is more successful than most swoopo users: he says he has won 27 items over the past few months, including digital cameras, tvs and macintosh computers. but his strategy, he says, is simple, bullheaded persistence. he spends up to two hours in each auction and makes sure he outspends other bidders.";X

 the group made strong progress in the first half of 2017, with an accelerating  pace of technology, innovation and product development, and a further strengthening of our customer relationships and market reach.  these enhanced capabilities have reinforced the group's ability to drive future growth by capitalising on the structural growth drivers in the payments market, and have further increased the group's already strong visibility of future earnings.  the group delivered a robust financial performance, against the exceptionally strong growth we saw in the first half of 2016.  the value of transactions processed increased by 11% to gbp241.4bn, similar to the rate of growth in 2016.  this supported net revenue growth of 11% which, while it included a

 global ecom delivered further strategic and financial progress.  net revenue grew 17%, representing a sustained strong performance given the 25% growth in the first half of 2016.  the majority of global ecom's growth continues to be derived from its existing portfolio of customers, notably in this half year in the retail, airline and digital industry verticals, benefiting from both their underlying growth, and wallet share gains as we enhance the value we deliver to  them.  in terms of products, acquiring, treasury management and foreign exchange services, and gateway saw strong growth in this period.  global ecom also performed well in retaining and expanding contracts with existing customers, including azul, hong kong express and dwi digital cameras, amongst others.  global ecom's pipeline of potential new business remains very strong, further supporting the visibility of growth in the division over the longer-term. in the first half of the year, global ecom signed a number of contracts with new customers from a broad mix of industry verticals and geographies, including vanilla air, hobby king, televisa and copa.  global ecom continues to increase its exposure to faster-growing regions in terms of geography, with the division's asia-pacific and latin american business growing at substantial rates.  the strong growth in these regions is being supported by new acquiring capabilities in brazil and argentina which have created a strong platform for growth in the latin american region.  the group also continued to further strengthen its global acquiring network, with the launch of domestic acquiring capabilities in malaysia and turkey, helping to improve transaction acceptance, while maintaining their full compliance with  local rules and regulations.  the strength of global ecom's customer proposition was further reinforced in the first half by the delivery of a broad range of new products and enhancements.  these included updates to the applepay and androidpay mobile

 wpuk made good progress in the first half on its strategy to deliver more value for merchants, and delivered net revenue growth of 2%.  this result reflects a demanding comparative period in the first half of 2016 (with very strong net revenue growth of 12%), year-on-year increases in scheme fees, and the deceleration in uk consumer spending growth towards the end of the first half of 2017.  wpuk is expected to deliver strong net revenue growth in the second half of the year, primarily driven by changes in sales strategy, pricing  changes to recover the increased scheme fees, and the accelerated take-up of value-added products and services.  underlying ebitda also grew 2%, a strong performance given a gbp3.3m bad debt charge relating to the collapse of a travel sector merchant.  underlying ebitda also included for the first time an allocation of costs relating to the new acquiring platform; excluding these, operating costs fell by 3%.  in the sme segment, my business dashboard, wpuk's online merchant tool, now
